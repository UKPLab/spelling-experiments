As part of this initiative a full time Professorship on CL was opened for 2010 and since 2009 CL is taught as postgraduate facultative course for the Master on Linguistics. Other courses on Formal Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) were accepted and will be part of the offer in 2010. Additionally, the School of Philology, Linguistics and Literature approved the creation of a NLP laboratory (project number 021-A9-734 of the Vicerrectoria  de Investigacion,  main resarcher, Prof. Jorge Antonio Leoni de Leon,  assistant researcher, Prof. Carla Jara Murillo), which is expected for 2010, and should support research and teaching, especially because a course on data processing for undergraduate students on Linguistics and Philology is under consideration.

Computational graduate students have showed their interest on CL courses at the Postgraduate Program in Linguistics. Some of them come to the course looking for knowledge on CL, since because of their jobs they need a good understanding of NLP technologies. Although we lack of details about the job they do with NLP, the works of Berrocal Rojas (2009) and Cedeno  Baltodano (2009) for the postgraduate program on Computational Sciences illustrate the growing interest in the field. At the moment, only one student started, this year, her Master's thesis on CL at the Postgraduate Program on Linguistics at the University of Costa Rica.

Off universities' campus, it's important to mention the Centro Nacional de Alta Tecnologia (CE-NAT), which has projects sharing similarities with CL, but with totally different aims. For example, we can cite the projects on human memory modelisation (in collaboration with the Programa de Investigaciones en Fundamentos de la Educacion  a Distancia, PROIFED, UNED) and an adaptation of computational learning methods to a parallel and distributed processing platform. CENAT has contacts with several organizations at international level. CENAT is a state inter-university research institution on super computation.

We are aware of postgraduate students working in related areas in another countries, but we do not have details about their plans for the future. Nevertheless, national industry has not waited to have graduated specialists in order to start the commercialization of NLP related software. For example, Wordmagic Software developed symbolic machine translation software Spanish-English and Tecapro presented an orthographic correction software. Because of secrecy in the industry, it is difficult to know how many companies appeal to NLP technologies. Enterprise are also make themselves present in the field by scientific grants, in 2007 Juan Rodriguez  won a prize proposing a glove allowing translation between sign language and Natural Langue.

Presently, the idea is that Computational Linguistics would play a role, at different levels, in Lexicography and Spanish as a second language (L2). This leads to the creation of parsing systems and large corpora, where collaboration is desired. Another interesting area for CL is dialectology, where the tradition, as in Lexicography, of large collaborative initiatives exists. The new NLP laboratory will have workstations exclusively dedicated to research and the creation and storage of large copora as an intensive international initiative could be possible.

The signing of specific collaborative agreements between academic institutions is the preferred way to accomplish international research projects. This facilitates the approval of fundings.

In Costa Rica, CL is finding its path. At this moment it is mainly an academic interest, but, as we saw, there already are industrial products, where, eventualy, graduated students could find professional employment.

In the University of Costa Rica, where CL is rapidly growing up, collaborative initiatives are possible in a specifc and well defined frame. Additionally, many students are coming to CL, with the new academic offer. And this tendecy can increase in the next years.

In this moment, there is no CL community in Costa Rica. Before we are able to build it, we need to create a solid ground where a CL community could firmly stand up. This is starting to happen at the University of Costa Rica, where individual initiatives begin to gather around the recent course on CL taught by Prof. Jorge Antonio Leoni de Leon.  We hope this movement will continue with the next opening of the NLP Laboratory at the School of Philology, Linguistics and Literature in the University of Costa Rica. This laboratory will fill the lack of equipment to make research on CL. Nevertheless, the need of a permanent research group will be there. This is an understandable situation in the sense that CL is a very new branch in the University and especially in liberal arts. This allows us to think that students will incorporate to CL studies and projects once the equipment and the offer on courses will be normal. It is expected that this year (2010), School of Philology, Linguistics and Literature will have a full time professor on CL, who will dedicate at least 1/2 of his time to research.
