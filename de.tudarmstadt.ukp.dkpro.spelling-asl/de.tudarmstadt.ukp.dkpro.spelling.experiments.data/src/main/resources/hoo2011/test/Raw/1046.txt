Idioms are not only interesting but also distinctive in a language for its continuity and metaphorical meaning in its context. This paper introduces the construction of a Chinese idiom knowledge base by the Institute of Computational Linguistics at Peking University and describes an experiment that aims at the automatic emotion classification of Chinese idioms. In the process, we expect to know more about how the constituents in a fossilized composition like an idiom function so as to affect its semantic or grammatical properties. As an important Chinese language resource, our idiom knowledge base will play a major role in applications such as linguistic research, teaching Chinese as a foreign language and even as a tool for preserving this non-material Chinese cultural and historical heritage.

An idiom is a multi-word expression that has a figurative meaning that is comprehended in regard to a common use of that expression that is separate from the literal meaning or definition of the words of which it is made (McArthur, 1992). From a linguistic perspective, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech that are contradictory to the principle of compositionality. The words that construct an idiom no longer keep their original meaning or popular sense, while in the process of its formation it develops a specialized meaning as an entity whose sense is different from the literal meanings of the constituent elements. Although an idiom is an expression not readily analyzable from its grammatical structure or from the meaning of its component words, it is the distinctive form or construction of a particular language that has a unique form or style characteristic only of that language. An idiom is also used, in most cases, with some intention of the writer or to express certain emotion or attitude. Thus in nature, idioms are exaggerative and descriptive and do not belong to the plain type.

Therefore, to classify idioms according to its emotional property or descriptive property is important for many practical applications. In recent years, emotion classification has become a very popular task in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which tries to predict sentiment (opinion, emotion, etc.) from texts. Most research has focused on subjectivity (subjective/objective) or polarity (positive/neutral/negative) classification. The applications with this respect include human or machine translation, automatic text classification or Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL). For example, when a student learning Chinese as a foreign language encounters an idiom in his or her reading or conversation, for better understanding it is important for him or her to know whether the idiom is used to indicate an appreciative or derogatory sense which is very crucial to understand the attitude of the idiom user. Another example is that long articles about politics in newspapers often include a lot of idiom usage to boost their expressiveness and these idioms may carry emotional information. Obviously by knowing the emotional inclination we may easily obtain a clue about the general attitude of the particular medium. We may even be able to detect or monitor automatically the possible hostile attitude from certain electronic media which today provide so huge amount of information that seems hard for human processing on a daily basis.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of a Chinese Idiom Knowledge Base (CIKB) and introduces its several applications so far. Section 3 concludes the related work that serves as the basis of the building of CIKB and the emotion classification experiment introduced in this paper. Section 4 describes the classification method, feature settings, the process of emotion classification and the analysis of the result. Section 5 includes conclusions and our future work.

Generally an idiom is a metaphor - a term requiring some background knowledge, contextual information, or cultural experience, mostly to use only within a particular language, where conversational parties must possess common cultural references. Therefore, idioms are not considered part of the language, but part of a nation's history, society or culture. As culture typically is localized, idioms often can only be understood within the same cultural background; nevertheless, this is not a definite rule because some idioms can overcome cultural barriers and easily be translated across languages, and their metaphoric meanings can still be deduced. Contrary to common knowledge that language is a living thing, idioms do not readily change as time passes. Some idioms gain and lose favor in popular literature or speeches, but they rarely have any actual shift in their constructs as long as they do not become extinct. In real life, people also have a natural tendency to over exaggerate what they mean or over describe what they see or hear sometimes and this gives birth to new idioms by accident.

Most Chinese idioms are derived from ancient literature, especially Chinese classics, and are widely used in written Chinese texts. Some idioms appear in spoken or vernacular Chinese. The majority of Chinese idioms consist of four characters, but some have fewer or more. The meaning of an idiom usually surpasses the sum of the meanings carried by the few characters, as Chinese idioms are often closely related with the fable, story or historical account from which they were originally born. As their constructs remain stable through history, Chinese idioms do not follow the usual lexical pattern and syntax of modern Chinese language which has been reformed many a time. They are instead highly compact and resemble more ancient Chinese language in many linguistic features. Usually a Chinese idiom reflects the moral behind the story that it is derived. (Lo, 1997)
