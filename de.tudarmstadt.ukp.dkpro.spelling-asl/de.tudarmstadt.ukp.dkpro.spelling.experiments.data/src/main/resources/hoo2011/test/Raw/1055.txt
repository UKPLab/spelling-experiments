This work models Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP). To model WSD as a DCOP, we view information from various knowledge sources as constraints. DCOP algorithms have the remarkable property to jointly maximize over a wide range of utility functions associated with these constraints. We show how utility functions can be designed for various knowledge sources. For the purpose of evaluation, we modelled all words WSD as a simple DCOP problem. The results are competitive with state-of-art knowledge based systems.

Words in a language may carry more than one sense. The correct sense of a word can be identified based on the context in which it occurs. In the sentence, He took all his money from the bank, bank refers to a financial institution sense instead of other possibilities like the edge of river sense. Given a word and its possible senses, as defined by a dictionary, the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) can be defined as the task of assigning the most appropriate sense to the word within a given context.

WSD is one of the oldest problems in computational linguistics which dates back to early 1950's. A range of knowledge sources have been found to be useful for WSD. (Agirre and Stevenson, 2006; Agirre and Martinez, 2001; McRoy, 1992; Hirst, 1987) highlight the importance of various knowledge sources like part of speech, morphology, collocations, lexical knowledge base (sense taxonomy, gloss), sub-categorization, semantic word associations, selectional preferences, semantic roles, domain, topical word associations, frequency of senses, collocations, domain knowledge. etc. Methods for WSD exploit information from one or more of these knowledge sources.

Supervised approaches like (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002; Lee and Ng, 2002; Martinez et al., 2002; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001) used collective information from various knowledge sources to perform disambiguation. Information from various knowledge sources is encoded in the form of a feature vector and models were built by training on sense-tagged corpora. These approaches pose WSD as a classification problem. They crucially rely on hand-tagged sense corpora which is hard to obtain. Systems that do not need hand-tagging have also been proposed. Agirre and Martinez (Agirre and Martinez, 2001) evaluated the contribution of each knowledge source separately. However, this does not combine information from more than one knowledge source.

In any case, little effort has been made in formalizing the way in which information from various knowledge sources can be collectively used within a single framework: a framework that allows interaction of evidence from various knowledge sources to arrive at a global optimal solution.

Here we present a way for modelling information from various knowledge sources in a multi agent setting called distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP). In DCOP, agents have constraints on their values and each constraint has a utility associated with it. The agents communicate with each other and choose values such that a global optimum solution (maximum utility) is attained. We aim to solve WSD by modelling it as a DCOP.

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to model WSD as a DCOP. In DCOP framework, information from various knowledge sources can be used combinedly to perform WSD.

In section 2, we give a brief introduction of DCOP. Section 3 describes modelling WSD as a DCOP. Utility functions for various knowledge sources are described in section 4. In section 5, we conduct a simple experiment by modelling all-words WSD problem as a DCOP and perform disambiguation on Senseval-2 (Cotton et al., 2001) and Senseval-3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds, 2004) data-set of all-words task. Next follow the sections on related work, discussion, future work and conclusion.

Only the agent has knowledge and control over values assigned to variables associated to it. The goal for the agents is to choose values for variables such that a given global objective function is maximized. The objective function is described as the summation over a set of utility functions.

An agent is allowed to communicate only with its neighbours. Agents communicate with each other to agree upon a solution which maximizes the objective function.

Collocations of a word are known to provide strong evidence for identifying correct sense of the word. For example: if in a given context bank cooccur with money, it is likely that bank refers to financial institution sense rather than the edge of a river sense. The word cancer has at least two senses, one corresponding to the astrological sign and the other a disease. But its derived form cancerous can only be used in disease sense. When the words cancer and cancerous co-occur in a discourse, it is likely that the word cancer refers to disease sense.

Most supervised systems work through collocations to identify correct sense of a word.
