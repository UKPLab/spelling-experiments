Dzongkha, the national language of Bhutan, is continuous in written form and it fails to mark the word boundary. Dzongkha word segmentation is one of the fundamental problems and a prerequisite that needs to be solved before more advanced Dzongkha text processing and other natural language processing tools can be developed. This paper presents our initial attempt at segmenting Dzongkha sentences into words. The paper describes the implementation of Maximal Matching (Dictionary based Approach) followed by bigram techniques (Non-dictionary based Approach) in segmenting the Dzongkha scripts. Although the used techniques are basic and naive, it provides a baseline of the Dzongkha word segmentation task. Preliminary experimental results show percentage of segmentation accuracy. However, the segmentation accuracy is dependent on the type of document domain and size and quality of the lexicon and the corpus. Some of the related issues for future directions are also discussed.

Segmentation of a sentence into word is one of the necessary preprocessing tasks and is essential in the analysis of natural language processing. This is because word is both syntactically and semantically, the fundamental unit for analyzing language structure. Like in any other language processing task, Dzongkha word segmentation is also viewed as one of the fundamental and foremost steps in Dzongkha related language processing tasks.

The most challenging features of Dzongkha script is the lack of word boundary separation between the words. So, in order to do the further linguistic and natural language processing tasks, the scripts should be transformed into a chain of words. Therefore, segmenting a word is an essential role in Natural Language Processing. Like Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) languages, Dzongkha script being written continuously without any word delimiter causes a major problem in natural language processing tasks. But, in case of CJK, Thai, and Vietnamese languages, many solutions have been published before. For Dzongkha, this is the first ever word segmentation solution to be documented.

In this paper, we describe the Dzongkha word segmentation, which is performed firstly using the Dictionary based approach where the principle of maximal matching algorithm is applied to the input text. Here, given the collection of lexicon, the maximal matching algorithm selects the segmentation that yields the minimum number of words token from all possible segmentations of the input sentence. Then, it uses non dictionary based approach where bigram technique is applied. The probabilistic model of a word sequence is studied using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The approach using the MLE has an obvious disadvantage because of the unavoidably limited size of the training corpora (Nuges, 2006). To this problem of data sparseness, the idea of Katz back-off model with Good-Turing smoothing technique is applied.

Dzongkha language is the official and national language of Bhutan. It is spoken as the first language by approximately 130,000 people and as the second language by about 470,000 people (Van Driem and Tshering, 1998).

Dzongkha is very much related to Sino-Tibetan language which is a member of Tibeto-Burmese language family. It is an alphabetic language, with phonetic characteristics that mirror those of Sanskrit. Like many of the alphabets of India and South East Asia, the Bhutanese script called Dzongkha script is also a syllabic. A syllable can contain as little as one character or as many as six characters. And a word can be of one syllable, two syllable or multiple syllables. In the written form, Dzongkha script contains a dot, called Tsheg that serve as syllable and phrase delimiter, but words are not separated at all.

The frequent appearance of whitespace in the Dzongkha sentence serves as a phrase boundary or comma, and is a faithful representation of speech: after all in speech, we pause not between words, but either after certain phrases or at the end of sentence.

Since, our language has no word boundary delimiter, the major resource for Dzongkha word segmentation is a collection of lexicon (dictionary). For such languages, dictionaries are needed to segment the running texts. Therefore, the coverage of a dictionary plays a significant role in the accuracy of word segmentation (Pong and Robert, 1994).

The dictionary that we used contains 23,333 word lists/lexicons. The lexicons were collected from 'Dzongkha Dictionary', 2nd Edition, Published by Dzongkha Development Authority, Ministry of Education, 2005, (ddc@druknet.bt). The manually segmented text corpus containing 41,739 tokens are also used for the method. The text corpora were collected from different sources like newspaper articles, dictionaries, printed books, etc. and belong to domains such as World Affairs, Social Sciences, Arts, Literatures, Adventures, Culture and History. Some texts like poetry and songs were added manually.

Table below gives the glimpse of textual domains contained in the text corpora used for the method (Chungku et al., 2010).

In Dzongkha word segmentation, Katz back-off model based on Good-Turing smoothing principle is applied to handle the issue of data sparseness. The basic idea of Katz back-off model is to use the frequency of n-grams and if no n-grams are available, to back off to (n-1) grams, and then to (n-2) grams and so on (Chen and Goodman, 1998).
