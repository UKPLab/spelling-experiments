To organize hierarchical semantic verb class, we take a top down and a bottom up approaches. As for a bottom up approach, we use verb senses defined by a dictionary as the most fine-grained meaning; and then we group verbs that can be considered to share some meaning. As for a dictionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita et al., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000 verbs with explanations of word sense and example sentences.

As a top down approach, we take three semantic classes: State, Change of State, and Activity as top level semantic classes of the thesaurus according to Vendler's aspectual analysis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4). This is because the above three classes can be useful for dealing with the propositional, especially, resultative aspect of verbs. For example 'He threw a ball' can be an Activity and have no special result; but 'He broke the door' can be a Change of State and then we can imagine a result, i.e., broken door. When other verb senses can express the same results, e.g., 'He destroyed the door', we would like to regard them as having the same meaning.

We define verb classes in intermediate hierarchy by grouping verb sense on the basis of aspectual category (i.e., action, state, change of state), argument type (i.e., physical, mental, information), and more detailed aspects depending on aspectual category. For example, walk the country, travel all over Europe and get up the stairs can be considered to be in the Move on Path class.

Verb class is essential for dealing with verb meanings as synsets in WordNet. Even if we had given an incorrect class name, the thesaurus will work well if the whole hierarchy keeps is-a relation, namely, the hierarchy does not contain any multiple inheritance.

The most fine-grained verb class before individual verb sense is a little wider than alternations. Currently, for the fine-grained verb class, we are organizing what kind of differentiated classes can be assumed (e.g., manner, background, presupposition, and etc.).

The aim of describing arguments of a target verb sense is (1) to link the same role arguments in a related verb sense and (2) to provide disambiguated information for mapping a surface expression to a verb sense. The Lexeed database provides a representative sentence for each word sense. The sentence is simple, without adjunctive elements such as unessential time, location or method. Thus, a sentence is broken down into subject and object, and semantic role labels are annotated to them (Figure 3).

The principal function of the semantic role label name is to link arguments in a verb class. One exception is the Agent label. This can be a marker discriminating transitive and intransitive verbs. Since the semantic class of the thesaurus focuses on Change of State, transitive alternation cases such as 'The president expands the business' and 'The business expands' can be categorized into the same verb class. Then, these two examples are differentiated by the Agent label.

As described in Section 3.1, we incorporate compositional semantic structure to each verb class to describe syntactically motivated lexical semantic relations and entailment meanings that will expand the thesaurus. The benefit of compositional style is to link entailed meanings by means of compositional manner. As an example of entailment, Figure 5 shows that a verb class Move to Goal entails Theme to be Goal, and this corresponds to a verb class Exist.

In this verb thesaurus, being different from previous LCS studies, we try to ensure the compositional semantic description as much as possible by means of linking each sub-event structure to both a semantic class and example sentences. Therefore, we believe that our verb thesaurus can provide a basic example data base for LCS study.

We did manual evaluation that how the proposed verb thesaurus covers verb meanings in news articles. The results on Japanese new corpus show that the coverage of verbs is 84.32% (1825/2195) in 1000 sentences randomly sampled from Japanese news articles. Besides we take 200 sentences and check whether the verb meanings in the sentences can correspond to verb meaning in our thesaurus. The result shows that our thesaurus meaning covers 99.5% (199 verb meanings/200 verb meanings) of 200 verbs.

Table 1 and Table 2 show a comparison of statistical characteristics with existing resources. In the tables, WN and Exp denote the number of word meanings and example sentences, respectively. Also, SRL denotes the number corresponding to semantic role label.

Looking at number of concepts, our Thesaurus has 709 types of concepts (verb classes) which is similar to FrameNet and more than VerbNet. This seems to be natural because FrameNet is also language resource constructed on argument structure. Thanks to our thesaurus format, if we need more fine grained concepts, we can expand our thesaurus by adding concepts as new nodes at the lowest layer in the hierarchy. While at the number of SRL, FrameNet has much more types than our thesaurus, and in the other resources VerbNet and EDR the number of SRL is less than our thesaurus. This comes from the different design issue of semantic role labels. In FrameNet they try to differentiate argument types on the basis of the assumed concept, i.e., Frame. In contrast with FrameNet we try to merge the same type of meaning in arguments. VerbNet and EDR also defined abstracted SRL; The difference between their resources and our thesaurus is that our SRLs are defined taking into account what kind of roles in the core concept i.e., verb class; while SRLs in VerbNet and EDR are not dependent on verb's class.

Table 2 shows that our thesaurus does not have large number in registered words and examples comparing to EDR and JWordNet. As we stated in Section 3.5, the coverage of our verb class to newspaper articles are high, but we try to add examples by constructing annotated Japanese corpus of SRL and verb class.

One of the difficulties of annotating the semantic class of word sense is that a word sense can be considered as several semantic classes. The proposed verb thesaurus can deal with multiple semantic classes for a verb sense by adding them into several nodes in the thesaurus. However, this does not seem to be the correct approach. For example, what kind of Change of State semantic class can be considered in the following sentence?
