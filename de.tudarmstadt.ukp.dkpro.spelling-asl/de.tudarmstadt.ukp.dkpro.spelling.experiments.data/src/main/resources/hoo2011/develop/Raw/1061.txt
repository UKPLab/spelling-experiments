Motivated by Google Sets, we study the problem of growing related words from a single seed word by leveraging user behaviors hiding in user records of Chinese input method. Our proposed method is motivated by the observation that the more frequently two words co-occur in user records, the more related they are. First, we utilize user behaviors to generate candidate words. Then, we utilize search engine to enrich candidate words with adequate semantic features. Finally, we reorder candidate words according to their semantic relatedness to the seed word. Experimental results on a Chinese input method dataset show that our method gains better performance.

We also tried other co-occurrence based measures like mutual information, Euclidean and Jaccard distance, and found that weight harmonic averaging gives relatively better results. Due to space limitation, we are not able to report detailed results.

As stated before, we utilize search engine to enrich semantic features of the input seed word and top N candidate words. To be more specific, we issue a word to a search engine (Sogou, 2004) and get top 20 returned snippets. We regard snippets as the context and the semantic representation of this word.

For an input seed word w, we can generate top N candidate words using formula (2). We issue each word to search engine and get returned snippets. Then, each word is represented as a feature vector using bag-of-words model. Following the conventional approach, we calculate the relatedness between the input seed word w and a candidate word c as the cosine similarity between their feature vectors. Intuitively, if we introduce more candidate words, we are more likely to find related words in the candidate sets. However, noisy words are inevitably included. We will show how to tune parameter N in the experiment part.

As a result, candidate words with higher semantic similarities can be returned earlier with enriched semantic features. Re-ranking can be regarded as a complementary step after candidate generation. We can improve the performance of related word retrieval task if we consider user behaviors and re-ranking together.

In this section, we demonstrate our experiment results. First, we introduce the dataset used in this paper and some statistics of the dataset. Then, we build our ground truth for related word retrieval task using Baidu encyclopedia. Third, we give some example of related word retrieval task. We show that more related words can be returned earlier if we consider semantic features. Finally, we make further analysis of the parameter tuning mentioned before.

We carry out our experiment on Sogou Chinese input method dataset. The dataset contains 10,000 users and 183,870 words, and the number of edges in the constructed bipartite graph is 42,250,718. As we can see, the dataset is quite sparse, because most of the users tend to use only a small number of words. For related word retrieval task, we need to judge whether a candidate word is related to the input seed word. We can ask domain experts to answer this question. However, it needs a lot of manual efforts. To alleviate this problem, we adopt Baidu encyclopedia (Baidu, 2006) as our ground truth. In Baidu encyclopedia, volunteers give a set of words that are related to the particular seed word. As related words are provided by human, we are confident enough to use them as our ground truth.

We randomly select 2,000 seed words as our validation set. However, whether two words are related is quite subjective. In this paper, Baidu encyclopedia is only used as a relatively accurate standard for evaluation. We just want to investigate whether user behaviors and re-ranking framework is helpful in related word retrieval task under various evaluation metrics.

In this paper, we have proposed a novel method for related word retrieval task. Different from other method, we consider user behaviors, semantic features and re-ranking framework together. We make a reasonable assumption that if two words always co-occur in user records, then they tend to have a close relationship with each other. Based on this assumption, we first generate a set of candidate words that are related to an input seed word via user behaviors. Second, we utilize search engine to enrich candidates with semantic features. Finally, we can reorder the candidate words to return more related candidates earlier. Experiment results show that our method is effective and gains better results.

However, we also observed some noisy words in the returned results. As our dataset is generated from Chinese input method, users can type whatever they want, which will bring some noise in the dataset. We plan to remove noisy words in the future. Furthermore, we want to take the advantage of learning to rank literature (Liu, 2009) to further improve the performance of related word retrieval task. We may need to extract more features to represent the word pairs and build a labeled training set. Then various machine learning techniques can be used in this task.

Another important issue is how to build a complete and accurate ground truth for related word retrieval task. People may have different opinions about whether two words are related or not, which makes this problem complicate.

Thirdly, our method can only process a single seed word, so we aim to extend our method to process multiple seed words. In addition, we want to build a network of Chinese word association. We can discover how words are organized and connected within this network. And this word association network will be quite useful for foreigners to learn Chinese.

Fourthly, how to deal with ambiguous query word is also left as our future work. For example, query word 'apple' can refer to a kind of fruit or an IT company. As a result, we are expected to return two groups of related words instead of mixing them together.

Finally, our dataset provides a new perspective for many interesting research tasks like new word detection, social network analysis, user behavior analysis, and so on. We are trying to release our dataset for research use in the future.
