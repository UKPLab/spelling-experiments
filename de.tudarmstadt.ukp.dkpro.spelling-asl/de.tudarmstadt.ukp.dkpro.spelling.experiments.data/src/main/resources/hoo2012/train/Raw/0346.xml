      <P>Dear Mrs Helen,</P>
      <P>I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you giving me.</P>
      <P>Fist of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is hotest mounth in the year, and the weather shall be really nice.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I think it is would be better to stay tents, so than we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play in.</P>
      <P>However, as you asked me to choose two activities, I'm choosing swimming and climbing, because I'm very good at swimming and I would like to try myself at climbing. Despite the small expereance in climbing I do want to try this type of sport.</P>
      <P>In addition, I would like to know how much money do I have to bring with me.</P>
      <P>I think that it is all what I would like to know.</P>
      <P>I'm looking forward to hear from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
