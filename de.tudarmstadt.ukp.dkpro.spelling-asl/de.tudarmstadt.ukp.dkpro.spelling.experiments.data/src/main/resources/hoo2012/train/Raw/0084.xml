      <P>Dear Helen.</P>
      <P>It is so nice to hear the news from you that I have won the first prize. I'm looking forward to getting sun-tanned under the sun in California.</P>
      <P>Here are the information which you asked me for. I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take off days.</P>
      <P>Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid of July.</P>
      <P>I'd prefer to say in log cabins. Because our family had some bad experiences with using tents. Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent.</P>
      <P>It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled.</P>
      <P>Especially I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money for me.</P>
      <P>Thanks</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dearest Kim</P>
      <P>How are you? I wish you are fine. I'm fine either but I'm quite busy to find another part time job after the one, which was the concert supporting one.</P>
      <P>I remember that you asked me to tell you about that job. It was fantastic but a bit hard!</P>
      <P>First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office. It was quite terrible when I had to let people leave, because all tickets were sold out.</P>
      <P>Then the concert started, I was called from one of the staffs for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next work I was gives was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore?</P>
      <P>It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested. But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even join that fantastic atmosphere.</P>
      <P>What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium. And that mad the concert absolutely perfect.</P>
      <P>I wish this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together.</P>
      <P>Stay pretty and lovely!</P>
      <P>Kisses from </P>
