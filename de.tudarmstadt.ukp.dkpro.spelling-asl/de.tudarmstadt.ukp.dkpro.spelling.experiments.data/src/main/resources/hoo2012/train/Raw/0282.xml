      <P>Dear Mr. Ryan</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter. I have just received the letter from you. I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition at Camp California in U.S.A.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday. I would like to use a tent for my accommodation. I think it is more interesting than log cabins. I can be more next nuture and I have never used tents before. It seems to be exciting.</P>
      <P>I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming. When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games. It was such a good time. I enjoy painting as well. My mother told me that I'm good at painting. When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition. My parents were very pround of me.</P>
      <P>Could I ask you some questions? I would like to know which kind of clothes I should bring to the camp. How much money should I bring there and can I use my credit card at the camp?</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter. I'm sorry that I've taken such a long time to reply your letter because I'm really busy and I have to study harder. I'm taking the final exam next month. Lucky me!</P>
      <P>I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I worked as a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really exciting. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do in the concert.</P>
      <P>It was such a big concert. There were lots of singers and band. Of course, there were lots of spectaculars. First, I was in front of the entrance door. I had to check tickets. I was really exciting. My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well. After that, I went to the back stage. I could see lots of pop stars. I'm sorry that I didn't ask them to take any pictures for you. I was really busy. I had to take care of them and did everything they want. For instance, taking them to toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff. It was really busy but I really enjoyed it.</P>
      <P>I learnt lots of thing from here that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I knew lots of people from different job. It was a great time.</P>
      <P>I'd better close now. I've got lots of homework to do. Take care of yourself and I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
