      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had last evening going to the theatre.</P>
      <P>According to the advertisement, one of the actor who had to show was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another disappointing actor instead of him.</P>
      <P>By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it had to start at 19:30: it wasn't in late, it was to much in late. We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for.</P>
      <P>And what's more, there weren't discouts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter in were the actors and the staff.</P>
      <P>Well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I pretend to have my money back, I waisted Â£20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programm I payed for.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to hearing from you soon</P>
      <P>Your sincerely</P>

      <P>Science and technology have changed man's life: that's true, I don't need to look how they affect the lives of the others, I have only to see how they have changed my life.</P>
      <P>Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that borns from the technology. Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of tv in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to have further information about something intersts you.</P>
      <P>But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed: in my mind all must be in order like in a CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take part of my life. In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in order to meet new people, to speak with them to have a contact with the "human world". Am I crazy? No, I'm only a daughter of the technology.</P>
      <P>Yesterday my grandmother asked me what will I do without the computer. I answered to her saying I probably will die.</P>
