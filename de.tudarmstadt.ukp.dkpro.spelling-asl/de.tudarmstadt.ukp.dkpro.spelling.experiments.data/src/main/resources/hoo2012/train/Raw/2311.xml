      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing this letter to show whom disappointed am I with the musical show "Over The Rainbow".</P>
      <P>First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared.</P>
      <P>When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight.</P>
      <P>Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for discount but they weren't available.</P>
      <P>When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed.</P>
      <P>I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed. So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back.</P>
      <P>yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Modern technology have been changing the human life since the first many was born.</P>
      <P>When I wake up I take a shower using eletricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus, when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave than I watch t.v. and do my homework using a pen, when I come back from jiu-jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed.</P>
      <P>About a millenium ago every thing was different the people didn't have electricity, they did their food on the fire and they didn't have pens.</P>
      <P>Comparing these too realities the reader can notice that modern technology changed very much our daily life.</P>
