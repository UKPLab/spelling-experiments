      <P>Dear Madam,</P>
      <P>With regard to your letter, I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible such a wonderful event as your competition is.</P>
      <P>If it was possible id prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July. In August I'll be working, so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month.</P>
      <P>About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.</P>
      <P>It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Gil Sanchez</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Sorry for not having written you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting you has been the accummulation of exams during this month.</P>
      <P>Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did you know I'm one of them?</P>
      <P>There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers. During the two hours of concert we had to attend thirty-six people, who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! It's the best thing you can do in this case.</P>
      <P>Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon.</P>
      <P>Lots of love.</P>
      <P>Gil Sanchez</P>
