      <P>Dear Mrs Ryan,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to give you the information you requested in your letter dated March, 31st, in which you informed me that I have won first prize in your competition.</P>
      <P>I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has accepted my holidays on that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in log cabins. I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days.</P>
      <P>It's difficult for me to chose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball. I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport. I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy.</P>
      <P>I would be very grateful if you could give me some aditional information. What type of clothes must I take? Is it necessary to take dressed cloth for any formal events? Must I take cash money or can I use the credit cards? Thank you in advance for your help.</P>
      <P>I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Thanks for your last letter. I can understand why you are impatient to hear about my experience at the concert last month. I have met our favourite singer, Celine Dion! She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert.</P>
      <P>We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed. Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert.</P>
      <P>And then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me!</P>
      <P>I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph.</P>
      <P>Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D.</P>
      <P>Let me know if you are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up.</P>
      <P>Please, come!</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
