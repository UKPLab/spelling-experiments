      <P>Dear Ms.</P>
      <P>I am writing to you becaus I was very disappointing with the presentation you have made to attract people to come to your theatre.</P>
      <P>First of all I came to see a play just becaus my faivourite actrice shoud of been part in it, but she didn't. The evening time on a tiket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15 which made visitors stay in a plase for 45 min, waist of time. The tickets discounts was not available under any subconstanses and the theatre restaurant was closed.</P>
      <P>I strongly do recomand your to pay minimum 50% of the full price for what I've payed.</P>
      <P>Your faithfull</P>
      <P>Mr. Farydone.</P>

      <P>Fashion of the Future.</P>
      <P>I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly different. In my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming as well as people become more niceer, less will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray. It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable. Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and Green pease will very strong community, much stronger and pouful than it is now. So as we can think the Future Fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people. The stile will be more or less simelar to each other and everyon will be setisfaid with its needs.</P>
