      <P>Dear Helen Ryan</P>
      <P>I am writing to inform you about your question. At first, I would like to go travel on July, because before them I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my study.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to stay in log cabin. I think it is more convenient than in tents.</P>
      <P>And I would like to have a chance about painting and photography. I am not so fit and well condition, so I don't like to do activitily. However, to draw some beautiful sceanary and to take some picture are very good experience for me. I hope so much.</P>
      <P>Thank you for your invitation.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>Do you like the shopping? Generally many women would like the shopping include me. Even the young girl wants to go shopping with mum. However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy the shopping? Perhaps you have an experience unpleased.</P>
      <P>You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover you bought something then you could find it is a little bit expensive than the other shop. Both cases are often happened in shopping.</P>
      <P>If you don't want to regret about shopping, you have to make a shopping list firstly before going shopping. Then you should check the price and the quality of the good.</P>
      <P>If you remember these two things at least, you could enjoy the shopping. One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are going only a window shopping.</P>
