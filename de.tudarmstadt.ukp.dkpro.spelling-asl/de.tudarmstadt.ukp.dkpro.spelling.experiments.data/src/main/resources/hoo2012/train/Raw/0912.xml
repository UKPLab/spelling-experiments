      <P>Dear Mr Robertson,</P>
      <P>I am writing in behalf of my class- maid about the programme you had organised for us.</P>
      <P>We all want to thank you for having choose such good places in London. We are especially excited about the river trip to greenwich which will be in the first day.</P>
      <P>I would particularly like to talk about the second day. We really liked the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for London fashion and leisure show that will happen on tuesday and we are very interested in go. As you know our class are composed by girls and it would be very exciting for us if we can have a look on the latest fashions, make up and so on.</P>
      <P>Although we would like to visit the science museum, we can leave it to the next opportunity, what we suggested to do is intead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure show and keep the afternoon programme the same.</P>
      <P>We hope you accept this change for good.</P>
      <P>We are looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.</P>
      <P>Last summer I went to amazon on an expedition with other 10 people, such as a guide, a doctor, a scientist and all the rest as me were just curious.</P>
      <P>We walked all day and took rest in the evenings. We were not allowed to leave out tents during the night or until the day start, because of the dangerous animals which leave there. But for me it was the most exciting moment. One can be really amazed by the view.</P>
      <P>One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without seen and started walking towards the river, because I want take some photographs of the sun rise. The view took my breath of when suddenly something took my breath. It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as she was very hungry. I knew I could not do any moviment for my safety but I did and for my surprise It run away.</P>
