      <P>Dear Sir/Madam</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about the problems were exist on the musical show.</P>
      <P>First of all you said that the starring would be Danny Brook but there was not. Another actor took his place.</P>
      <P>After that, the time that the show should start was 19:30 but it started fortyfive minutes later. People have been started to complain.</P>
      <P>What about the available discounts. They were not exist.</P>
      <P>You have to excuse me but this was a very disappointing evening. I would like to return to me my money back.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed with you. I did not expect these problems from you. I am waiting your answer as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully </P>

He told him, that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth the best friend of Jane. He didn't told the secret because he wanted to heard Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very shame to ask Jane in date.</P>
      <P>So, Beth, asked Jane if she is in love with Brian and she said that she was.</P>
      <P>When Pat heart the good news he told to Brian to asked her in date and he knew that she will accepted.</P>
      <P>Brian learm what was happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him. Jane and Brian were very happy.</P>
      <P>Brian and Pat had a lot of arguments about this because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
