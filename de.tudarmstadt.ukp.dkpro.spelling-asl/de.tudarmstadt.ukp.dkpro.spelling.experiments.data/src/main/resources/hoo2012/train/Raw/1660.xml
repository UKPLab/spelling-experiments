      <P>To whom it may concern,</P>
      <P>I have recently received a letter saying I am a first-prize winner for your competition. I was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and is the most convenient time for me.</P>
      <P>At Camp California, I would preferably like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable.</P>
      <P>The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing. I think they are a good contrast. I have not done sailing for quite a long time so I might find it difficult but I am looking forward to it. As well as a good exercise, I would also be able to learn something new. I have never done Photography before.</P>
      <P>I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings. I would appreciate it if you also advise me on how much money I should take. It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before.</P>
      <P>Please send me additional information soon.</P>
      <P>Thank you for your time and your kind effort.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely,</P>

      <P>When you think of the word 'shopping' a smile always comes onto your face. Shopping is thought of as enjoyable. Teenagers go shopping for leisure and to socialize.</P>
      <P>There are more than one kind of shopping though and one particular kind is window-shopping.</P>
      <P>I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up at a high street to go shopping. For me, that was window-shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew thought that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway.</P>
      <P>I went back everyday just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money.</P>
      <P>When I received my monthly pay, I rushed down to the shop and without thinking, bought that dress. I went back to where I was before - with no money (and a black dress) all over again.</P>
      <P>When I think about it now, shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
