      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you for the letter which I have received with a great delight and excitement. I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have required.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to travel in July as it is my summer holiday and I believe the weather would be best for camping in July. And if it is possible I would like to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I find tents uncomfortable to sleep in.</P>
      <P>The two activities I would like to do at the Camp are Tennis and surfing. I have been playing Tennis for many years and it is my favourite sport. However, I have never done surfing before but I have always wanted to learn how to do it and I believe this would be my best chance to do so.</P>
      <P>Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and wheather there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies. Also the amount of money I need to bring (is there any shops). And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who does art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school.</P>
      <P>When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert. We were all given different sort of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers.</P>
      <P>It was the best day of my life and certainly for others, too. I wish you were there. It was fantastic. I will be looking forward to your reply.</P>
      <P>Love from</P>
