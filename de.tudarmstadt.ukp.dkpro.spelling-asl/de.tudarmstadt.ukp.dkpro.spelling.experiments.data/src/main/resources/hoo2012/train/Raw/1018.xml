      <P>Dear Mr Robertson,</P>
      <P>Regarding the programme you have organised, it is great ideas everything that you have planed, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement.</P>
      <P>The idea about going to science museum is fantastic, I read about the museum, it is really interesting in science history. After all morning in the Museumtuesdayshopsstudenttuesday</P>
      <P>On Wednesday after viseted national Art Gallery, we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>The advertisement that students saw is about a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>

      <P>Freedom!</P>
      <P>Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and television is private life of famous people.</P>
      <P>It is really interesting how people like knowing famous people life. Without someone famous know, photographs take pictures secretly, try to get money on it.</P>
      <P>Sometimes being famous can get stress, everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions questions.</P>
      <P>Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places, because nobody like famous politicians or film stars without asking questions.</P>
      <P>On the whole, to be rich and famous don't always bring happeness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous.</P>
