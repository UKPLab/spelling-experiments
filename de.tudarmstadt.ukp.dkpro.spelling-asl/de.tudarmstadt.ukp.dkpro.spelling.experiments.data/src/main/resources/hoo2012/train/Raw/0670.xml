      <P>Dear Ms Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter. I am very happy to hear that I have won the first prize. I am writing to inform you about my requests. I also have some questions.</P>
      <P>First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' for my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times.</P>
      <P>Finally, could you please let me know what kind of clothes I should take with me? I would also like to know how much money I should take with me.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you and travelling to the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Chi Kimura</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Last month I helped at a pop concert. The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'. This bank is not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A very famous. I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience.</P>
      <P>First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The music instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in flesh.</P>
      <P>The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work. I was so exited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band.</P>
      <P>I want to help at a pop concert again!</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
