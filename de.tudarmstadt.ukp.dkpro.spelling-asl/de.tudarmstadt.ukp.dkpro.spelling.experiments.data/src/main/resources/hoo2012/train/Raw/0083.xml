      <P>Dear Helen Ryan</P>
      <P>Competition Organiser</P>
      <P>I recived your letter about I won two weeks at camp California in the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>I would like travel July because I will have holidays in this mounth.</P>
      <P>About the accommodation at camp, I prefer in tents because I love sleep in tents, is more interesting than sleep in log cabins.</P>
      <P>I would like do climbing and sailing while I'm at the camp, I can climbing very well I used to climbing ten years ago in my country.</P>
      <P>I'm worried about what kind of clothes I will need in the camp? and how much money I have to carry for the trip? Could you answer my questions please as soon as you can, because I'm nervous, and I need your soon answer, and I will have talk with my parents about camp.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely</P>

      <P>I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Nowadays, the people are always buying anythings maybe they don't need this things, only buy because is in fashion.</P>
      <P>In the first place, when the people think only in go to the shopping forgot others things: play with their children, talk with than parents, friends.</P>
      <P>In the other hands, when the people go to shopping spend a lot of money.</P>
      <P>I my view, is more enjoyable do others things than go to shopping because, maybe "you lose your money".</P>
