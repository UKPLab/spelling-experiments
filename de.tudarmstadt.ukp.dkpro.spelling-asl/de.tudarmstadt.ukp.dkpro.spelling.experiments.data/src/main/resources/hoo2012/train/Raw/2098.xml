      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I would like to point out the problems when I went to watch your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at the Circle Theatre.</P>
      <P>On your advertisement, you have written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I have expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.</P>
      <P>Also, the times printed on your advertisment was 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late.</P>
      <P>On your advertisment, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available.</P>
      <P>I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and on your advertisment, it made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting. However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated.</P>
      <P>It was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisment said it would be, and I would like some refund back. I hope you would give these problems your immediate attention.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
    </PART>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever?</P>
      <P>When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends.</P>
      <P>I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce.</P>
      <P>When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day, to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse.</P>
      <P>However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.</P>
      <P>My happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car.</P>
      <P>The news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover.</P>
      <P>I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now. I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret.</P>
