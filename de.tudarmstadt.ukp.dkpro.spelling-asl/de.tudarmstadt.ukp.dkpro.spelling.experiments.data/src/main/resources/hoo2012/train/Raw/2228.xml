      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I am delightful to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all paid in advance. I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to the problems beyond my control. Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad.</P>
      <P>I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them.</P>
      <P>It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them. I came second last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled photography classes. In the camp I can practise them alot.</P>
      <P>I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency. Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another. But I finally got around writing and you'll see that it's definetly worth waiting as I have some great and unbeliavable news to tell you.</P>
      <P>As you know I'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do much more different things apart from studying my A-level history, such as meeting up my friends, visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own.</P>
      <P>However this term has been a far cry from the others. You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettible one when you read through my letter.</P>
      <P>Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite. Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs some of which I put in the envelope. It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments. Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my life</P>
      <P>write me soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
