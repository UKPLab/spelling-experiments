      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called "Over the rainbow" at The Circle Theatre. I saw an advertising which seemed very atractive to me.</P>
      <P>I have to say, it was not the best musical show. I think it was pretty bad. I had a very disappointing evening for many reasons.</P>
      <P>Firstable, I decided to come see your show to be pleased by the act of Danny Brook as I was so sad to find an other actor on the stage. Another thing was the hours. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's enbelievable to be late with 45 minutes.</P>
      <P>When I got to the tickets desk before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available as I read on the advertising.</P>
      <P>After the show, I went to the restaurant to have a drink after all of these disappointments, but the doors were close because of renovations.</P>
      <P>I think you will understand it was not "my perfect evening out" as you said, but one of the worth. For all these reasons I am asking you to give my money back.</P>
      <P>Best Regards,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she put me in such trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed together in a host family in the surburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met very interesting so everything was perfect. We had mostly a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I had only 19 years old as everyone know that the majority for beeing able to go out in the USA is 21 years old. If you don't have the majority your aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or even worth to go in a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and me decided to go out in a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in it. At the entrance, the security guard asked for identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I've forgot it home. The man said it was OK for this time and we get in quite easely, we've made it. It was such a fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to be thirsty. We went at the bar and ask for drink with alcohol. Of course by the time we get in it we forgot all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking any time 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening, ending with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping so well a secret!!</P>
