      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing in connection with the musical show I saw in your theatre a week ago.</P>
      <P>Although the show was supposed to be the London's newest and best musical show, I am rather disappointed with it. Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage. However, you changed actors without informing viewers.</P>
      <P>As if this were not enough, the show was forty five minutes late. Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject.</P>
      <P>According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused being given a discount.</P>
      <P>On top of everything, the theatre restaurant was closed.</P>
      <P>You can imagine how disappointed I must be to spent such an imperfect evening. I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this mater further.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving your prompt reply.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Recently, we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.</P>
      <P>However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon cars from city centres, closed down factories which produce too much sewage. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably.</P>
