      <P>Shooping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>We all have been shooping once in our lifes and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we had a class discussion and we all agree in some points.</P>
      <P>For example if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were looking for, and instead of buing what we came for we will go out with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be waste of time.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then is where the problems begin. Most of the times one get lost, or they start plaing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get on a bad mood and you'll have a bad shooping day.</P>
      <P>So if you want to have a good relaxing shooping day, we recommend you not to go with your little brothers and to go with enogh time to look arround for what you really want.</P>
