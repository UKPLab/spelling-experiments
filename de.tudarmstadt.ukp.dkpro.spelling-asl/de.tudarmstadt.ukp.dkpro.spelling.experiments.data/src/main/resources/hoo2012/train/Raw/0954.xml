      <P>Dear Ms Clark,</P>
      <P>I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival wich is a great idea.</P>
      <P>I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. As I saw on the advertisement, there were stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries. It would be better if there were more than six countries.</P>
      <P>I noticed that some concert halls were too small. I wonder if you could offer outside concerts.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films. Don't you think you could create dramatic courses? Visitors could learn plays with professionals.</P>
      <P>Finally, the idea of a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we pay only once and we can see all the events.</P>
      <P>I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerly,</P>

      <P>Dear George,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter which I've just received.</P>
      <P>You ask me to tell you about school rules and what we are allowed to do at home in France. I don't think the rules are so different between England and France but I'm going to try to give you examples.</P>
      <P>Firstly, at school, we missed a course, we must bring a medical attestation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE.</P>
      <P>At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss with our family. There are so many rules but it would be too long if I had to explain all of them.</P>
      <P>l'm looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Best regards,</P>
