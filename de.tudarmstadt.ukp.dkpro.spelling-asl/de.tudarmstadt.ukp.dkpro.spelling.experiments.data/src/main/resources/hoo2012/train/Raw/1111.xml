      <P>Dear Ms. Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for the kind letter you have sent me. I am very pleased and very excited that I have won - I can't wait to go to the Camp!</P>
      <P>At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying. However I will be free in July - but please not that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California.</P>
      <P>For the accommodation, I would like to stay in tents as I have never slept in one before. It would also be a chance to try it out for the first time in my life.</P>
      <P>I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp. I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches. I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never took proper lessons.</P>
      <P>Also, can you please be kind enough to tell me what sort of clothes I should take? Would the weather be quite hot? Would you recommend me to take an extra bottle of sun block?</P>
      <P>Lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropiet to take? Would there be a bank near the camp?</P>
      <P>Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>MIDORI FUYU</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Hi! How are you? Thanks for your letter.</P>
      <P>You want to know everything about the concert? Okay - here it goes!</P>
      <P>Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall. God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the groups instruments, lights, microphones... I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as my balloons as we can and sprayed them with gold and silver.</P>
      <P>The concert went terrific, too! There must have been hundreds out there - dancing, laughing, shouting.. and I was having a time of my life! I handed out refreshment to the pop group's members during breaks - my friends were so jealous of me!</P>
      <P>At the end of the concert, when it was after midnight and everyone had alread left, the group came up to each of us (who helped out) and thanked us personally! I mean, isn't that really nice of them? We shook hands and they even wrote (scribbled?) their signatures on my T-shirt! I guess this was the best part of the night!</P>
      <P>Really, Kim, you should try this out some time. Even though I was exhausted, it was really worth it!</P>
      <P>Anyway, now I'm back to the real world - I have exams next week, wish me luck!</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
