      <P>Dear Kim</P>
      <P>Hi! How are you? Thank you for your kind letter and I am glad to hearing about your news.</P>
      <P>Kim, I would like to tell you my wonderful experience last month! On 5th of May which was national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time work at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome.</P>
      <P>The pop singer called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert was start 7.00 p.m. At that time I was in the second floor where I had to work is. I did a part of gard job. I stood up in front of audiences and I had given an attention to them. I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs. I thought if you were here I could really enjoy with you.</P>
      <P>All of her funs were stooud up the whole concert and dancing. I was so exciting night.</P>
      <P>Some of funs were not good at all because they shouted and argued, but most of people were very good. I had enjoyed so much with my wonderful experience.</P>
      <P>I am looking</P>
      <P>Please give my regards to your family</P>
      <P>Love</P>
