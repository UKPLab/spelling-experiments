      <P>Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spent the hole last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show "Over The Rainbow" was (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city. But from the beginning we found a lot of problems. Despite we are actors we had to pay a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our "perfect evening out" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show. I am waiting your answer,</P>

      <P>HOW HAS MODERN TECHNOLOGY CHANGED YOUR DAILY LIFE?</P>
      <P>My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.</P>
      <P>Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic.</P>
      <P>Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space.</P>
      <P>Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays, and send my work to the office everyday.</P>
