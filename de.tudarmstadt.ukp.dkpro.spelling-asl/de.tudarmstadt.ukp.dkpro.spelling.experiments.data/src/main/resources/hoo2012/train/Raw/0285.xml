      <P>Dear sir or madam,</P>
      <P>My name is Molly Menbrook. I have seen your new musical, 'Over the rainbow'. I am sorry but I must admit it was a bit disappointing.</P>
      <P>I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant except it wasn't open. I couldn't see anyone inside either. No one.</P>
      <P>The show it self was quite disappointing. The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors. I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical...</P>
      <P>Also you mentioned a discount. For tickets. Well no, I didn't get a discount! And the tickets were pretty expensive...</P>
      <P>Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in. Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the runner of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him.</P>
      <P>So you see my point. It wasn't very pleasant. So I am going to ask for a refund... I hope this isn't affending you too much... Or asking you for too much.</P>
      <P>Reply as soon as possible,</P>
      <P>best regards,</P>

      <P>I think the clothes in future will be similar in shape as the clothes that exist now. Just like sweaters, shoes, t-shirts etc... But maybe not.</P>
      <P>When it comes down to color, I think it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery. Like shiny and plastic kind. Maybe silver and gold, glittery red, purple and blue. As well as bright yellow, orange and green. All suitable for discos!</P>
      <P>Shoes will be high heeled and modern. Colors to match the clothes. Still, comfortable. I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens.</P>
      <P>But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick in them!</P>
      <P>Though some people may fancy the glitter and the spacy feel, I don't like it and I hope it really isn't the style for the future. It's just not my cup of tea...</P>
