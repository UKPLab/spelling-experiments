      <P>Dear Ms Ryan,</P>
      <P>I was enthusiatic about receiving your letter. I will give you all the necessary information.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work, my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to stay in tents rather than in log cabins, because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different.</P>
      <P>As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming. I am good at playing Tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be a useful training for me.</P>
      <P>Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money.</P>
      <P>I want to thank you for this prize, let me know if you need further information.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Bianca Botticelli</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working in a concert was great.</P>
      <P>You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart from the musicists and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets, the number on them and taking the people to their seats.</P>
      <P>It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they didn't want to wait for my help; so they went around the theatre, looking for their seats and making so much noise.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I think that people never grow up, if they had been a class of children, they would have made less noise!!</P>
      <P>Anyway, it was a great experience in spite of these little problems.</P>
      <P>Now I have to go, write soon and let me know what you have been doing.</P>
      <P>Lots of love</P>
      <P>Bianca</P>
