      <P>13rd of June</P>
      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I was really happy when your letter arrived and I node that I won the first prize in your competition.</P>
      <P>I have never been in the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>Now I will give you the informations which you asked for. For me it is only possible to travel in July. That is the only month where I have time because after July I have to start with the University.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I am used to it. When I was a child my parents and I spent a lot of time at camps.</P>
      <P>You wrote that I should choose two activities. I have chosen golf because I playing golf sine 1998 and I want to improve it and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start with climbing. I could play in the first week golf and in the second I could start with climbing.</P>
      <P>What about money and clothes? You know what kind of clothes I need and could you give some advices how much money I will need?</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it.</P>
      <P>Honestly I had never a shopping tour which I didn't enjoy when I was alone.</P>
      <P>I can remember one shopping tour which I had with a man and it was nightmare.</P>
      <P>It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows and it is not easy to buy shoes you have to choose carefully.</P>
      <P>I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything.</P>
      <P>We left the shop without shoes, in horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour which was not enjoyable.</P>
      <P>To sum up, my advise is that the women should go alone or with a female friend.</P>
