      <P>Dear Ms Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition.</P>
      <P>I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month.</P>
      <P>About accommodation, I would prefer log cabins, because I have a problem in my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not fairly comfortable.</P>
      <P>As far as camp activities concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years, for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing. On the other hand, I keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California? In addition, could you advice me how much money I need for the trip? and is there anything else do I have to know?</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely</P>

      <P>Hello Kim,</P>
      <P>I've received your letter two days ago and I'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E. I'm ok and let me tell you about my last experience.</P>
      <P>I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it.</P>
      <P>He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while.</P>
      <P>I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very simply.</P>
      <P>I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail.</P>
      <P>Well my friend, I have to go, because I got an appoinment with the Dentist. Write me soon and take care.</P>
      <P>Best wishes</P>
