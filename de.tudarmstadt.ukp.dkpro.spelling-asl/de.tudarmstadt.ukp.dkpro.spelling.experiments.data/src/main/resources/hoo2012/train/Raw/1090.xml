      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writting to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the actors who starring was not Dany Brook as it was advertised but one other actor, whose performance was very bad. That made the show disappointing.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the show should began at half past seven. despite these fact the show began at a quarter to eight.</P>
      <P>Also, there was not available tickets and after these bad musical show the restaurant of the theatre was closed.</P>
      <P>My evening was not very pleasant as you advertised. As a result of that I demand to have some of my money back.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully, </P>

      <P>If I say that technology has not changed my life I would be lying. If fact technology change in a major point my life.</P>
      <P>Can you imagine your life without a car or a television? I don't. Technology so much my life which I could not live without it.</P>
      <P>But technology doesn't only makes my life better. By the use of car I do not only get an easy way to move, but I destroy my enviroment. Also, if I use the car, in small distances when I can go on foot, I destroy my physical situation.</P>
      <P>Could you imagine your life without a television or a computer? I could not. Althouth with the computer I can contact with my friends and with the television I relax, I could not find another way to relax and contact with others.</P>
      <P>Technology is very important for my life. It makes my life more easier, and it would be much more difficult to live without it</P>
