      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week holiday. While there I saw your advertisement for the show "Over the rainbow" and decided to go.</P>
      <P>I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, it was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, as it was mentionned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else.</P>
      <P>After the show was over, it was not possible to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed that day.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfuly,</P>

      <P>Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say changed it.</P>
      <P>I will take the exemple of the use of the internet. I use it on a daily basis for many different reasons:</P>
      <P>I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail through the internet and the person received it within seconds.</P>
      <P>I don't need to go to the stores anymore, if I don't want to: I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it: books, video tapes, clothes and even groceries.</P>
      <P>It is also possible to read the news or play games.</P>
      <P>I also have the possibility of making new friends: I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people.</P>
