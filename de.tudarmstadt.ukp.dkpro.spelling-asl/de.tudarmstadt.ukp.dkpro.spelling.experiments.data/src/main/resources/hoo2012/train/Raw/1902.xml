      <P>Dear Mrs Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for your letter. I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition. I am now writting this letter to give you further information about myself with pleasure.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the date I would like to travel on would only be in July. Since I am a full-time student, I will not have finished my lessons until the end of June. In addition, I will be busy with my cousework in August.</P>
      <P>Regarding to the accomodation, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to the nature. I am sure I will have a lot of fun and release myself from the busy study totally.</P>
      <P>I am pretty good at painting. I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college. On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six. Tennis is my favourate sports evant. So I would like to choose these two activities while I am at the Camp.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I have some questions to ask you. Since I have never been to U.S.A, I know nothing about it. Would you like to tell me how much should be taken with me as pocket money and what shall I wear at that time?</P>
      <P> I will be grateful for your help. I am looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Best wishes.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it.</P>
      <P>However, more and more people are now asking, "Is shopping always so enjoyable?" In my view, the answer is, NO.</P>
      <P>Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt?</P>
      <P>Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs Â£105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?</P>
      <P>More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style in this new generation!</P>
