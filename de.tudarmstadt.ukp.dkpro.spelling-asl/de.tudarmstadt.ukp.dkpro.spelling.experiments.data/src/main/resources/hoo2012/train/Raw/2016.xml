      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>First at all, I'd like to thanks for the prize Won. I'd like to know USA. this prize came in a good time.</P>
      <P>I'd like to travell in july because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For it the only one that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabins because I can't bear sleeping in a tent, I hate this kind of accomodation. But I love sports. I'd like to play Tennis and swimming these are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better I can swim, because since I was I child I've been practising it. I've already Won three prizes about it.</P>
      <P>And I'd like to know about what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too. I've never gone to USA before.</P>
      <P>I hope I will have a good journey.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely,</P>
      <P>ALBiTO.</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>We had a class discussion about shopping, for it I'm writing to tell about my opinion.</P>
      <P>I love shopping mainly when I am alone on when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax. When I got plenty of money sometimes I like spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girl friend.</P>
      <P>But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and sad is not a good idea to go to shopping.</P>
      <P>Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like more and shoes I love new shoes.</P>
      <P>One good idea to go to shopping is when you got plenty of money.</P>
      <P>ALBiTO</P>
