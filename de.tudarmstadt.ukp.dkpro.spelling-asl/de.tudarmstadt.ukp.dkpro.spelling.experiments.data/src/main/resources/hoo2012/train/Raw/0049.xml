      <P>Dear Mrs Ryan</P>
      <P>Many thanks for your letter.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel in July because I have got summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August. I think a tent would suit my personal life-style better than a log cabin because I love the nature.</P>
      <P>I would like to play basketball during my holidays at Camp California because I love this game. I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball-team. But I have never played golf in my life but with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting.</P>
      <P>I also would like to know how much money I will get from you for those two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear Kim</P>
      <P>Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experience I made.</P>
      <P>At first I had to clean the three private rooms of the stars. This was very boring but after I left the third room I met Brunner and Brunner. These two people are stars in our country... O.K. I am just kiding. I don't like the songs of Brunner and Brunner because this kind of music is very boring.</P>
      <P>I also had to clean the washing rooms. I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert.</P>
      <P>But after this serville work I met Eminem. I think you know his popular songs like "My Name Is". It was one of the greatest moments in my life. I had to bring him something to eat.</P>
      <P>It was a hard but also a funny work. You should try to called some experience during such a concert you would not regret it.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
