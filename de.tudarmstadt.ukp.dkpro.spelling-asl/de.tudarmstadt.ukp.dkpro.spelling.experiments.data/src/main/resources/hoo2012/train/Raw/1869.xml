      <P>Dear Miss Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me on the letter.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month summer vacation that is in July. I appriciate it if it will be the first two weeks of the month. Next, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I need to have a time to relax when I travel. Therefore, I would prefer a log cabin.</P>
      <P>For activities, my first choise is basketball. I have been playing it since I was nine years old. In high school, I was in a school team and I enjoyed playing it with my team mate, even though we were not a strong team. My second choise is golf. I had never played it until last month. However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a biginner, so I would like to practice and have fun at the camp.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I would like to know whether I should bring some money and what kind of clothes I should bring.</P>
      <P>Thank you for giving me this great opportunity. I will be expecting to hear from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Hideo Kojima</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I've got your letter yesterday. I enjoyed reading how you spent time with your family and had fun at the Park. Thank you.</P>
      <P>As I have told you, I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty, a local band in which one of my friends played guiter. He knew that I'd wanted to work at a concert hall, possibly as a lighting technician. So he suggested me to help their concert so that I could know behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought me to a room. He explained me that it was to controll the light. It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights. However, when it came to the real concert, it was very hard.</P>
      <P>When the concert was finished, I was exhausted but happy.</P>
      <P>I'll write you back.</P>
      <P>Friend,</P>
