      <P> Misses Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the oportunity to travel. You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accomodation I would like to have and so on.</P>
      <P>Travelling in July, I have to say, would be perfect for me because I have got my birtday the 24th of this month and I wish I could spend my birtday as well as possible, so it means there.</P>
      <P>I also would prefer to sleep into tents which are more comfortable and, because I have been doing lots of campings, I am quite used to this kind of accomodation.</P>
      <P>The activities I have choosen both represent a pation for me. Painting and swimming are my way to spend a good time especially on holiday.</P>
      <P>I may have a question for you to answer, please could you tell my how much money do I need to bring with me?</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>However it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more, it is very fashionable those times. They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do.</P>
      <P>Even people who haven't got lots of money go shopping anyway. Is it enjoyable to walk around shops, looking at nice stuff, without having enough money to spend on it? Is it enjoyable to go shopping when it is rush time or when it is very hot in summer for instance?</P>
      <P>Enjoying shopping isn't the reason for doing that. I think people either go shopping to change mind because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human being.</P>
