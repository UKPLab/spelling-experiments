      <P>Dear Miss,</P>
      <P>I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better.</P>
      <P>First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event.</P>
      <P>That is everything I have noticed about the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear Sharyl,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter. I really enjoyed reading it. I'm very happy to know you're pretty well.</P>
      <P>Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning!</P>
      <P>In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up. I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you!</P>
      <P>Take care. I'll write to you soon!</P>
      <P>Love,</P>
