      <P>Dear Mrs Clark,</P>
      <P>I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November. I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to. However, I feel that it could be even better next year.</P>
      <P>Firstly, according to your advertisement, the 'Stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries. I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that "our" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music.</P>
      <P>I really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so!</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to. However, I think a weekend is really too short. May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Magda,</P>
      <P>Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some school and home rules in my country, France.</P>
      <P>First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me.</P>
      <P>Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them (not always) but also speaks with them.</P>
      <P>At home is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like "don't speak with a full mouth"; "don't put your finger in your noise"; "say please and thank you"; "don't fight with your brother"; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.</P>
      <P>Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>With lots of love,</P>
