      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing to ask for some queries about your letter which I have received.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to travel Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June. Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp.</P>
      <P>Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that.</P>
      <P>Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would be appreciated it if you supply some towers, if possible.</P>
      <P>Thanks for your attention.</P>
      <P>I really look forward to receiving your reply soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>It seems ages since I wrote to you. How have you been? How's your new flat? When I received your letter with photographs of that flat, it really looked nice. Anyway, I'll tell you about my wonderful experience which I enjoyed at a pop concert.</P>
      <P>It took place in a Korea national center which was the biggest building in Korea. There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs.</P>
      <P>I helped to guide foreginers who would like to take participated in that. You know, I have studied English for two years in England. That's why I could attend to that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well.</P>
      <P>What I really enjoyed was meeting famous World singers such as Madona, Bon Jovi, Ena and so on. I got Madona's signature! Can you believe it? I'll show you that and some pictures.</P>
      <P>I really hope to see you soon.</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
