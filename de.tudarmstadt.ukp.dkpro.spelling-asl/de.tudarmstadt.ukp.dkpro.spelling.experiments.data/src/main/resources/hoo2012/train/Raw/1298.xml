      <P>Dear madame Jane Clark,</P>
      <P>I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago. I was there two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world.</P>
      <P>Well, here are some of my opinion and suggestions. First of all, I think there should more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists only from six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world.</P>
      <P>The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls to small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.</P>
      <P>Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events.</P>
      <P>Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate for the great sucess in the festival.</P>
      <P>yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Emily,</P>
      <P>Hello! It's been such a long time since we wrote to each other. Well, in the letter you wrote me, you asked some questions about school and house rules. Even though, I do have less than you, I'm still willing to change many things.</P>
      <P>In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either.</P>
      <P>At home, there are less rules. My parents don't really like putting rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back. But it existed since I was very young.</P>
      <P>I would like to change the rule not to speak in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish but I guess to learn. we should speak English all the time.</P>
      <P>Well, that's all. I hope one day you get to change what you wanted. I miss you and let's keep in touch. Bye..</P>
      <P>your Pal,</P>
