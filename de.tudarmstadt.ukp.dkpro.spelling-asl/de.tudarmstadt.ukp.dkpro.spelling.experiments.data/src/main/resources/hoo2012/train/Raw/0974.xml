      <P>Dear Mrs Helen Ryan;</P>
      <P>I recieved your congratulations letter for having won the first prize in your competition. I am very greatfull and I want to thank you very much for letting me do this trip.</P>
      <P>I think it is very kind of yous to ask me what my preferences are for the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays starts. Answering another of your questions, I am more likely to stay in a log cabin considering that I will be to weeks in the camp. They are much more confortable than tents.</P>
      <P>While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing. I have not done any of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it. I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes should I take, and how much money do you think I will need to bring with me.</P>
      <P>I want to thank you again for letting me have this unique experience. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</P>

      <P>Dear Kim; How are you? I's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Anyways, do you remember my last e-mail, where I told you that I was going to help at a Pop Concert. Well, I'm going to tell you about that awesome experience. The band played at my school so we could raise money for our graduation trip. I asked them if they could play at our school and they told me it would be 350 pounds. "The Moicznos" are so popular that we sold our every ticket and end up wining 2000 pounds. Appart from calling them, I also helped building up the stage, and took care of the lights. After the concert the whole class helped cleaning up the mess the people left. I can tell you that it was a wonderfull experience. What I liked the most about it is not the fact that we raised a lot of money, but that we enjoyed of an amazing show in which I took active part. The band thanked me very much for calling them and having everything so well organized. I hope you liked reading my story. Hope to hear from you soon. Love,</P>
