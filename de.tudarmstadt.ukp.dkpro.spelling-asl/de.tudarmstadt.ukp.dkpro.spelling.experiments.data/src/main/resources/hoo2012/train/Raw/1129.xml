      <P>Dear Ms. Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am so glad. I have won first prize in your competition! It was a really big surprise for me. I will join The Camp California in the U.S.A. with pleasure.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel there in July, because only in July I can have holiday. In June and in August I will have to work, so it would be rather impossible for me to join Camp California then. I would like to have an accomodation in log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent. So if I could choose I would like to stay in a log cabin. Being at the Camp I would like to swim and to play tennis. I have swam for 10 years and I have played tennis since I was 9 years old and those activities I like best.</P>
      <P>I thin I am the best in horse riding; I even have my own horse, so if it is possible I would like to ride horses at Camp California.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward for hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Felicia Zajac</P>

      <P>It was a bright, shinny day. I woke up early in the morning and I decided to go shopping.</P>
      <P>Warsaw's " Clif'' is my favourite shopping centre so I went there. I saw a beautiful, long dress. I decided to try it on.</P>
      <P>- What is your size - said shop-assistant.</P>
      <P>- 36 - I said.</P>
      <P>- Och, I am very sorry, but we have run out of 36 size.</P>
      <P>I was going to the chemist to buy some eye-shadow, when I saw black, suede shoes. Those shoes must be mine! - I thought. I went in and I asked the shop assistant if I could try it on.</P>
      <P>- Yes, of course- she replied- but what is your size?</P>
      <P>- 38 - I said.</P>
      <P>- I'am very sorry but we do not have 38.</P>
      <P>I was very angry. I had some money, I wanted to spend them, but?! Everything did not suit me! It was enough! I came back home - tired and angry. Surely it was not the best day for shopping. I did not buy anything, although I tried.</P>
      <P>So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoable.</P>
