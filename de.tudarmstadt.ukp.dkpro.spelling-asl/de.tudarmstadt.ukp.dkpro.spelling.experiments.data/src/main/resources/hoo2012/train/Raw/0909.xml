      <P>Dear Mr Robertson,</P>
      <P>I am writing, on behalf of the students in my class, to thank you very much for the trip to London. Besides, we would like to go to the London Fashion And Leisure Show, which was advertised in the newspaper "Metro" yesterday.</P>
      <P>This show takes place at Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 o'clock. All my classmates are very interested in this show, which includes latest fashions, Leisure and sports wear, Make up, and Hair styles. Moreover, one of the important thing for us is that entrance fee is free for students, because students are generally short of money.</P>
      <P>We would like to suggest you change shopping date to Wednesday afternoon, because we have free time on Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>We would be very pleased if you could consider our recommendation.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Private Life For Everyone.</P>
      <P>Everyone deserve private life. However most famous people, for example football player and film stars, have not got any privet life.</P>
      <P>They feel exhausted to be followed by journalists </P>
      <P>Even they have an argue with journalists as they sometimes write unreal news.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, some people need journalists to be more famous, because people can have news who are famous through journalists.</P>
      <P>As a result, journalists should respect their life and always write real news.</P>
