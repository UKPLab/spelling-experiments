      <P>Dear Mr. Robertson,</P>
      <P>I am writing on behalf of students in your English class. Firstly, we are please and would like to thank you for your arrangement to taking us to London for 3 days.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some students have seen an advertisements for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we all like to go to the show.</P>
      <P>This show will be taken place at Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March at 10.00 - 19.00, which include the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles.</P>
      <P>It is a great opportunity to visit because it is shown only twice a year and the entrance is free for students. Furthermore, most of us are designers so this might help to up-dated their knowledge as well.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would like to suggest that on Monday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March, we still stick with your plan. We might change the schedule on Tuesday 14 March, from visiting Science Museum to The London fashion and Leisure Show.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate if the matter can be settled down easily and look forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>I was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I remember when I was in secondary school. At that time, my friends and I was so daring and full of energy.</P>
      <P>One day before exam, we were so excited and frighten because we weren't ready for exam. We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk. One of my friend came up with the idea that we had to steal them. The question was who would be the person do this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me. I was so scare and frighten because if I was caught I would be punished.</P>
      <P>However, I had to do it otherwise my friend would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it.</P>
      <P>So, that afternoon in lunch time, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quitely and calmly. Finally, I was succeed in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it back without anyone saw me.</P>
      <P>That was the most scarely and daring thing that I did in my childhood. I wouldn't have imagined if I had been caught.</P>
