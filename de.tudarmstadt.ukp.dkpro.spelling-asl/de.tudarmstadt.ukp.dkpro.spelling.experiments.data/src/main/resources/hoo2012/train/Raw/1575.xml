      <P>I wright to complein about the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I had a very disapointing evening because of many things.</P>
      <P>First the actor was a wery common actor. then it start's 45 minutes lent. Also in the advicement they talk about discount tikets. Well they didn't accepted when I pay with my Â£20 discount tiket why? And at last I couldn't visit the theater restaurant after the show, it was closed, why? I don't know.</P>
      <P>Alslo I wanted to tell you that the show was very borring. It was alwais the saim. And it was to slow.</P>
      <P>Because all these things it obiously wasn't the perfect evening as it's seid in the advicement. So I wrought this letter to ask for my money back.</P>
      <P>Your's faithfully,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because after I told her that I have a new girlfriend, all the school knows it in lees than 2 hours.</P>
      <P>I have to explain to every body that, I formaly dond't have a girlfriend, I explein them that it's was a good posibility, nothing els, but noone belive me, because Pat has told them that I have a formal girlfriend. This problem with Pat had a lot of consecuences, because I had a very hevy discucion with her about that, it was so heay that one of ower teachers had to calm me, because I was very angree with her. The teacher send me to talk with the principal, who suspended me for discus in bad maners with a girl.</P>
      <P>So I was suspended, I had a fight with one of my best friend, all because she wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
