      <P>Dear Mrs. Jane X,</P>
      <P>I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been.</P>
      <P>First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think should be bigger for jazz, rock or still classical concerts.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year events, such as:</P>
      <P>- Funny plays and films to spend the break time;</P>
      <P>- Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night,</P>
      <P>- Art exbitions to know more things about artist's lifestyle; and</P>
      <P>- talks by writers to say how good is his latest book.</P>
      <P>In addictions, the ticket's price is too expensive and difficult to buy another one every day, so, I think is more effective if was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope will be better next year if these points was observed for the each year the event to be better than before.</P>
      <P>Sincerely</P>
