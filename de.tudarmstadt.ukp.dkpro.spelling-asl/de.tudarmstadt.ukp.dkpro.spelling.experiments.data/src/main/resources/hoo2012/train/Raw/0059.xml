      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing to answer all the questions that you made me in your last letter.</P>
      <P>First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. It is very important for me, because I always wanted to travel to the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>I would be able to travel only in July because it is the only month when I don't have to go to school.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to stay in a tent because as I had never slept in a tent, it would be a new experience for me.</P>
      <P>The two activities that I choose are: basketball and climbing. I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old. By the other side, I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it.</P>
      <P>I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take.</P>
      <P>I look forward to knowing the date of the camp.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it.</P>
      <P>As you know, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it.</P>
      <P>First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs.</P>
      <P>When the concert was finished, some friends and I went for a drink.</P>
      <P>It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours,</P>
