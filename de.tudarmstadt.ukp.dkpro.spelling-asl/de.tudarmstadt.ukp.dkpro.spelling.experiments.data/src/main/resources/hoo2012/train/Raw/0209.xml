      <P>Dear Mr Robertson,</P>
      <P>The reason of my letter, is that our class would like to suggest a few changes on our programme of London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme.</P>
      <P>First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon.</P>
      <P>Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion, the show would be fantastic, we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to make up. It's a great opportunity to know more about fashion. Please, let us go to the show, for students are free.</P>
      <P>I Look forward to hearing from you</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than it is now.</P>
      <P>In the future, our homes will have the most advanced technologies. Computer will take a important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because in the computer we would buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want in our computer. We won't have the necessity of going out from home, because computer will give us everything.</P>
      <P>Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love..., that kind of things will never change.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, in the future home our conditions of life will approve, and computer will be very important for us, but is won't control us, because we still have the most important thing of a home, that will be the same as now.</P>
