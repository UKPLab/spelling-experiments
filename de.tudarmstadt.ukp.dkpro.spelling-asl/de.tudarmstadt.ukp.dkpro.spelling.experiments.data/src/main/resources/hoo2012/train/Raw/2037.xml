      <P>Sir,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back for your "London's newest and best musical show: Over the rainbow", presented in the Circle Theatre.</P>
      <P>In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised on your advertisement, I had a very disapointing evening.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I expected to see Danny Brook in the show, but he was replaced by another actor. Why was he not here?</P>
      <P>Moreover I had to wait forty five minutes to see the beginning of the show. And I hate to wait! There was also the discounts wich weren't available.</P>
      <P>And to finish, the restaurant was closed, for any reasons you didn't take to us. So I couldn't eat this evening.</P>
      <P>Hoping you'll satisfy my request.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for the Leon's birthday had failed. However, we've started to search an idea for it for one months. In the beginning, I wanted to bring him in my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at his home. So Sigone found the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought for him a dog. Leon hate dog, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognized. And I found one. I had a friend who had just received a little dog. But he was a Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck.</P>
