      <P>The Home of the Future.</P>
      <P>As developing modern society, we will become to have more material than now. Invent glass was very eventuly.</P>
      <P>Architecuture with use of grassbroughthemodenism.</P>
      <P>In the future we can expect having new material and it will make our living more confortable and convinient. In Japan, crime of minority is increasing. It said that as one of the reasons small separete room makes kids unsociable and dissapointed.</P>
      <P>Therefore Japanese architect consider designing of use manyglasses and try not to create speparate dark room.</P>
      <P>Otherwise as producing new electoronic, our home of future will be more convinient. On the other hand inside of the house will be too simple. Although high might be still same. Because human high won't change so much, unless 10000 years passed.</P>
