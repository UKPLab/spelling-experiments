      <P>First of all we can't go shopping without money. Nowadays, most product's prices has gone up with our own country's economy development. Despite the poor material of product, we have to pay much money, even though we completely satisfied shopping at that time, we sometimes regret buying after the shopping. It sounds like foolish. However it often happen.</P>
      <P>Secondary the customer's service often makes us angry. Of couse, the shopkeepers are human being as well. But for their considerations, they're working in their rutines So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy.</P>
      <P>I sometimes loose my desire to buy a thing because of their badly behaviers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, shopping is just a part of life style. It's necessary to buy something to alive. We have to buy for some thing. For example, for our jobs supecial ceremonys and so on. Even when the risk comes up with shopping.</P>
      <P>To sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable for us</P>
