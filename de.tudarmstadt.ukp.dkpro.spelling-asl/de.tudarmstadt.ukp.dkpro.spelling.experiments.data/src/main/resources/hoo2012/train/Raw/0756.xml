      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about the show "Over the Rainbow" which I saw at your theatre two weeks ago; as a matter of fact our evening turned out to be very disappointing.</P>
      <P>First of all I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook, but sadly he wasn't there, he was filled in by a different actor, who was instead rather disappointing.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the show should have started at 19.30 but instead it began at 20:15 which was really unpleasant.</P>
      <P>At the ticket office I also asked for a discount but they told me this wasn't possible, instead your advertisement said clearly there were discounts available!</P>
      <P>At the end of the show I was so tired that I decided to eat something at your restaurant, but surprisingly it was closed due to some unreasonable technical problems!</P>
      <P>The advertisment assured us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate if you could refund completely our tickets.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets: he always wanted to know everything about everybody and after, of course, he would give away all he knew, but one day he had some problems...</P>
      <P>His best friend Paul couldn't put up anymore with Pat always revealing his secrets, so decided to play a trick on him. Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new misterious lover.</P>
      <P>Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially to the press. Pat obviously couldn't help being silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandalistic press, not knowing that Paul had made up all the story! On Sunday all the english press was waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all an invention, they got so angry that they wrote on every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!!</P>
