      <P>Dear Competition Organiser,</P>
      <P>I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've planned already the rest of my summer holidays. On June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there.</P>
      <P>An accommodation at the camp that is more suitable for me is in log cabins. I prefer that kind of accomodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but I can't have it in tent.</P>
      <P>I've also choosed two activities, swimming and sailing. These are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water, but I like them more than surfing.</P>
      <P>At the end I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp.</P>
      <P> Please answer me soon.</P>
      <P>Otto Zajac.</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shop in the center of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such a shops there is usually one or one or two sellers, what is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much of time and health.</P>
      <P>Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there is smaller crowd and more sellers work there. In these days people prefere shopping at supermarkets than at shops or even shopping areas, because shopping at shop is less enjoyable and you spent the same amount of money.</P>
