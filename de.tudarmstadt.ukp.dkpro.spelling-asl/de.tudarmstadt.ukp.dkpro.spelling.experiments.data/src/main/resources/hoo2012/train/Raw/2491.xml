      <P>Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was an other actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to, the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed for all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was Â£20 and there wasn't any discount! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I hadn't a great fun, so I ask for money back. Your faithfully</P>

      <P>In fact, some days before Karin, a friend of hers, had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John, her science's teacher. Pat was astonished, and didn't know what (she) had to tell Karla.</P>
      <P>The teacher was 40 years old, and Karla was only 16 (years old). This age's difference was too big!</P>
      <P>Besides, Karla was a shy, polite girl that Pat wanted to help.</P>
      <P>So she decided to tell Hill all the story. Hill like Pat very much, but only as a friend. He was 19 (years old), so Pat thought, that he had to know what was the best thing to do.</P>
      <P>But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousine. They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream. So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they had know her feelings to Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything forever.</P>
