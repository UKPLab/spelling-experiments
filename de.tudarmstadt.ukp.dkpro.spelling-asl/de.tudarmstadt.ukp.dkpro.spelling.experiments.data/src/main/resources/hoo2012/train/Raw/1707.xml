      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing with reference to an arrangement I made for your theatre show last week.</P>
      <P>I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see "Over the Rainbow" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't in the scene. Beside this, I had to wait three quarters of hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was no nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available, so, it was an expensive evening!</P>
      <P>I know you will understand my frustration and that's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that goes with my wishes.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. However, she was a close friend and I couldn't accuse her of nothing else.</P>
      <P>I won't never forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth of my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to face it at that moment but... I bursted into teas as well as my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely step by step. I got conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell it to Pat. I still remember her words: "Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed".</P>
      <P>I do really trusted her when three days after I went to school and I could appreciate I was catching the eyes of everybody. I couldn't stand being watched and my furious led me straight to Pat. She tried to apologise but it wasn't enough for me. My best friend had let me down.</P>
      <P>From that moment, I denied being with anyone until I met Cold, a sensitive dog, the one who would keep my secrets forever and would be near me until the end. Sure!</P>
