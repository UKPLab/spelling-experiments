      <P>Dear Mrs Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have received a letter from you saing that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me.</P>
      <P>I would like to travel on July because my hollydays are only on it and the wheather in California is better. I am that kind of person who enjoy to have a wild and simple life, so I prefer to be accommodated in tents.</P>
      <P>About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball which I have a lot of experience. The second one is sailing, but I am not so good in this sport.</P>
      <P>I would like to know some more information about the Camp, before I left, which clothes are more appropriate and how much money should I take with me.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Augusto Roy</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>How is everything? Is your dog better? Well here I'm very fine. I bought a new T.V., it's very big and I love it!</P>
      <P>In your last letter said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I enjoy it very much, it was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be the responsable with lights and sound. I told then that I will think about it but I belive I will accept the job.</P>
      <P>The most increible part was the laser show. They were drowing a lot of things in the sky during the concert.</P>
      <P>Next time I'll take you and your friend Monica. I'm shure that you are going to love it.</P>
      <P>Please write back</P>
      <P>Love and Peace</P>
      <P>Augusto.</P>
