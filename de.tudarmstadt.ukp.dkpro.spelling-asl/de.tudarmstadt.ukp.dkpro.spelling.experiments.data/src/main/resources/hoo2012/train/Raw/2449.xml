      <P>Dear Helen Ryan:</P>
      <P>I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permition from my work. At the same time, on july is my birthday, so it would be nice to celebrated there.</P>
      <P>I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent, couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girl. Sleeping in tent is much more exiting and clousy than a log cabin.</P>
      <P>I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires.</P>
      <P>Thankeaw for givin me this oportunity.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>You are never going to believe what I did last month I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when sudently a man stop us saying that he was looking for people to help in a concert and they was going to pay us five pounds an hour. We sed yes inmidiatly, I nearly shouted of happines when they told us that, Luis Miguel was doing the concert, he is my favorite singer.</P>
      <P>The concert was on a sunday and we had to work on the back of the stadge, doing all sorts of things like colecting rubish and helping other people that was working there. We was so close to him, I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind, I will never forget that day. Since then, me and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day.</P>
      <P>I hop you write me soon to tall me youre opinion.</P>
