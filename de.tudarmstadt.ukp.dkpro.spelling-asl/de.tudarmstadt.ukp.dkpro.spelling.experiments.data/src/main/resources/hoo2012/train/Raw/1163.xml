      <P>Dear Sir: I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, in the other case, I would have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I'm telling you this because I had a big trouble a few days ago because of her.</P>
      <P>Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I knew all the truth.</P>
      <P>I used to tell Pat everything about myself - my problems with my parents, my problems with the school, friends and more. I was always talking to her and she was always listening to me but she didn't talk to me very much about herself. At first, I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't care too much about that and I easily forgot it. In other words, Pat knew all my secrets.</P>
      <P>I started to get along with other people and had new friends but I continued telling Pat my secrets. My new friends sometimes talked to me about Pat and they asked me once if we were close friends. I asked them why they had asked me that. Their answer surprised me too much. They told me Pat used to be a close friend of them and she used to talk about me and my problems. So, they had already knew all my secrets for a long time!</P>
      <P> I got very angry and immediately I went to talk to Pat. At first, Pat denied all the things my friends told me about herself but she finally agreed with that. I asked her why she couldn't keep my secrets and she told me that it was impossible for her keeping secrets. She was very sorry about that and few days after she moved in to another city and actually I don't know anything about her. I thanked my new friends for not to tell anybody my secrets though before the trouble they and me weren't very friends. Now I'm very happy with my new friends and I have learnt that I can't trust anybody too much because you don't really know how the person is like.</P>
