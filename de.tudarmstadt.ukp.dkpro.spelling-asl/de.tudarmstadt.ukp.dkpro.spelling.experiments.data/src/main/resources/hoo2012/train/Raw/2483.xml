      <P>I would like to travel on july because I am a studant therefore I only have holidays in this part of the year.</P>
      <P>About the acomodations I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to stay in it when I travel.</P>
      <P>The activities that I want to do in the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall as well as I use to play it very well. On the other hand I don't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it cool.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to ask you. It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend with food and this kind of thing.</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.</P>
      <P>Sometimes, shopping can be really bore especially in important dates when the shop are absolutaly crowded and you can't see somethings as you wanted with carefull.</P>
