      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical, starting from the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.</P>
      <P>There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30. And I am asking you: Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience?</P>
      <P>I am closing this letter by saying you that that night was the most terrible night of my holidays and that I would like to have my money back, please</P>
      <P>I hope you will reply to my letter.</P>
      <P>Regards</P>
      <P>XX</P>

      <P>How has modern technology changed your daily life.</P>
      <P>We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.</P>
      <P>The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature.</P>
      <P>And not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really support is that if you know how to use technology is a benefit for you. If you don't is going to destroy you.</P>
