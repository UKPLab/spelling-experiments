      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>Last month I went to the theatre with my husband to see OVER THE RAINBOW. I'm sorry, but I had a very unpleasant evening.</P>
      <P>First of all, the play started 45 minutes later. I felt so angry about that. And discounts were not available (nobody explained the reason).</P>
      <P>Secondly, the actor wasn't Danny Brook. I wanted to see him! He is a good actor but I saw a very bad one.</P>
      <P>And we couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed.</P>
      <P>Such a bad night!</P>
      <P>I'm sure you will complain the reasons why I want my money back. If you couldn't do that, we will accept to go to another play.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And Lorca knew it. But Pat was in the wrong place in the incorrect hour. That's a story of a crime of passion. Let me explain it.</P>
      <P>In 1874 Lorca was the most beautiful white girl in her city (a small town near Savannah). Her family was very rich and a lot of men wanted to marry to her.</P>
      <P>But she was in love with a black man, called Jim. And Pat, the maid, saw them in the river. She couldn't keep the secret and told everything to another maid. In few hours everyone knew it. Pour lovers!</P>
      <P>When Jim's wife knew it she caught a gun and killed her husband. Then, she cried and cried holding him. (If she hadn't do it, Lorca's father would had made the same).</P>
      <P>It was a shock for Lorca. She jumped into the river and killed herself two days after.</P>
      <P>Pat and Jim's wife lived with the guilty all their long lives. How could they forget it?</P>
