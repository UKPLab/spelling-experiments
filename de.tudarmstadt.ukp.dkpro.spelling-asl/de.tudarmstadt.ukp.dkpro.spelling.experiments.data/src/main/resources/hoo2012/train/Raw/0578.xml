      <P>Dear Jean Clark,</P>
      <P>I recently spent two days at your Annual International Arts Festival and I am writing to express my opinion about it.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement.</P>
      <P>Secondly I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year. Finally, I think it was a good idea the fact to buy only one ticket for all the events since I just spent the time watching and enjoying all of them.</P>
      <P>I look forward hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Your sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear George,</P>
      <P>Sorry it's been too long since I last wrote but I've been so busy at school that I couldn't answer you before.</P>
      <P>As you tell me in your last letter you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First I must tell you that teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, mum and dad are great but there's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it.</P>
      <P>I really must get down to some homework now so I'll stop here. Give my love to your parents.</P>
      <P>Write to me soon</P>
