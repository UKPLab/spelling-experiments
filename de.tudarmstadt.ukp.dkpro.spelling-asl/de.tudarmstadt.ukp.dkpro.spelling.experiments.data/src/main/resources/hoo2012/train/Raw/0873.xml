      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I saw the musical show in your advertisment in my holiday. I was disappointed with it. I would ask you to my money back.</P>
      <P>First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but actually, starting was not Danny Brook but another person.</P>
      <P>Besides her acting didn't make me satisfied.</P>
      <P>Secondly, starting time was not 19:30 but 20:15. Because of it, I was waited for a long time,</P>
      <P>Also, there was no system that ticket can be discounted.</P>
      <P>Finally, I went to restaurant in your theatre but it was closed, I couldn't eat anything.</P>
      <P>That's nub of my complaints.</P>
      <P>Thus I spent terrible time - it was waste of time.</P>
      <P>I'm expecting for your reply soon.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>'Fashion of the future,</P>
      <P>I think after 100 years, at least something will change in the point that design, material, color, etc.</P>
      <P>If I pick up the example, Kimono (Japanese traditional cloth) will wear on not only Japan but also another countries in generally.</P>
      <P>Also it will be only wear but its design, shape might take in casual cloth.</P>
      <P>If it came true, imagination to make cloth would bigger and could think various design and format.</P>
      <P>By one country's traditional cloth taking in those of another country, it can born different type and new kind of fashion.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there might vanish personality (character) of each country.</P>
      <P>However, thinking way that simple is the best will not change.</P>
      <P>Also, comfortable cloth.</P>
