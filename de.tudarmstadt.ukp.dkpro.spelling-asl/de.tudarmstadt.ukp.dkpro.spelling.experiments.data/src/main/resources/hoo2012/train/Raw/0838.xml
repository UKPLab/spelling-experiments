      <P>Sir manager of the theatre,</P>
      <P>I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show in your theatre. With a friend we had seen your advertisement for the show, witch was very attractive.</P>
      <P>Unfortunatly, the musical show didn't go like the advertisement explained, and that wise I wont ask you some money back.</P>
      <P>The starring had been changed, the show had started only at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for some working inside. And your last phrasal of the advertisement "Your perfect evening out"! it wasn't at all, like I have explain you above in this letter.</P>
      <P>I thank you in advance an hope for a positive requiere.</P>
      <P>Bests regards,</P>

      <P>At the began of my work in a Insurance Company, I had only a old writting machine, witch makes a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with it because the switch were hard for my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, witch is very easy to use, and confortable for my fingers also more farrster. But wen the computer don't work, I got a big problem to do my work.</P>
      <P>Also now for write a letter to a friend overland it is better with Internet. It is so practical, in five minuts my friend can read my letter. And he can ansewer me very quickly. I think, it is now the futur for the big company for work with the Internet.</P>
