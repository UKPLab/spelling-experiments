      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I'm writing you followwing our visitting your theatre last night. As I saw from your advertisement in the newspaper, it said 'Starring: Danny Brook and Tina Truelove'. I was disappointed when I found the actor wasn't Danny Brook!</P>
      <P>And from your advertisement, the show should start at 19.30 but it didn't. It was 45 minutes late! And also I couldn't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement, it said 'discounts available' I was really annoyed by that!</P>
      <P>After the show, we expacted to eat something in your restaurant, but it closed! I have no idea why!</P>
      <P>We had a really unenjoyable time at your theatre. And I would like to know if it posible to have the money back.</P>
      <P>Thank you very much and I look forward to hear from you.</P>
      <P>Yours centainly,</P>
      <P>Porawek Phowrung.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets. So one week later all student in my class knew that I was an angle. Certainly! Nobody believed her... neither me.</P>
      <P>But it's true... I'm an angle and I wanted to visit the earth. It's easy to do but the only one rule was I can tell my secret to only one person. And if someone elso knows, I won't be able to go back to the heaven unless I kill the person who told my secret.</P>
      <P>Pat was the only person who I told my secret but now it has become a joke! I promised to myself... I would have to kill her!</P>
      <P>I started my plan. I went to Pat's house but her brother told me that she wasn't there. I offered to wait... Her brother and I began to talk... He's such a nice boy. I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too...</P>
      <P>We started to go out in the same time as I started to change my mind. I don't want to go back to the heaven anymore as long as I am with him.</P>
