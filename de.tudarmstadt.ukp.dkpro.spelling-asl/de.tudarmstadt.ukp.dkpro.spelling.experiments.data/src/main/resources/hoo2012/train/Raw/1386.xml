      <P>Mr. Manager:</P>
      <P>The porpouse of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical show "Over the Rainbow", wich really disapointed me.</P>
      <P>First of all, there were no diccounts avaible as it said on the anouncement so I had to pay the original price wich wasn't cheap at all.</P>
      <P>Then, I was forced to wait fourty five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 in stead of 19:30 and when it finally started, I was really disapointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it said on the anouncement.</P>
      <P>Finally, when the show finished, I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed for repairs.</P>
      <P>So, as you can see, it wasn't my perfect evening out at all that's why I demand you to send me my money back.</P>
      <P>Your really unsatisfied costomer</P>
