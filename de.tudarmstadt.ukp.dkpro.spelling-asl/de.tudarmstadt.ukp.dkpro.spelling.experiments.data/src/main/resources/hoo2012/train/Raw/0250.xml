      <P>Dear Jane Clark</P>
      <P>I went the international arts festival which you organized. Most of the events were good, but I felt that the festival could be even better next year. So, may I give you my suggestions and opinions?</P>
      <P>I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea! But the stars and artists who are from around the world were from only six countries. You had better invite more nationarities' people.</P>
      <P>And some concert halls were too small, so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films in the next year than this year's.</P>
      <P>I think the idea of one reasonably - priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent! Because it does not complex, also we don't confuse.</P>
      <P>If you can improve these points, your festival must be better than this year's.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Dear Johnny</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter.</P>
      <P>Anyway, you want to know about rules at home and school in my country, don't you?</P>
      <P>My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed many things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom in any time. Of course we can go out the classroom in any time.</P>
      <P>But some schools in my country don't allow many things. One of the rules of my friend's school is not to drink and eat something during a class. And the students have to wear the uniforms, so they can't chose their clothes.</P>
      <P>Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back my house until 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule!</P>
      <P>I really want to change this rule.</P>
      <P>Many of my friends have this rule.</P>
      <P>How about in your country?</P>
      <P>Love</P>
