      <P>Dear Manager,</P>
      <P>I am writing to you about the musical Show 'Over the Rainbow' I saw in London last weekend.</P>
      <P>To begin with, it was not Danny Book who acting in the show, as you wrotte.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the time in your advertisement told that it should start 19:30, but it did not start before 20.15</P>
      <P>And then about the tickets, you wrotte that they were discounts available but they were not.</P>
      <P>Finaly when we had seen the Musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because they done some dekoreting, and you wrott in your advertisement "Visit our theatre restaurant after the show"</P>
      <P>We are very disappointed, it was not a perfect evening out for us, therefore we would have your money back.</P>
      <P>I looking forwart to hear from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>HELGAR Svessen,</P>

      <P>Clothes in the future</P>
      <P>Clothes is very interesting subjekt to study. If you travlling around you can see lot of different still from different culture.</P>
      <P>At first I think that in the future we are going to wear less clothes because the climet are being warmer and warmer.</P>
      <P>Secondly I think we have more mixing clothes from all over the world, because we are traveling more and more around. And that is nice if you can pick up the best thing from all over the world, but on the other hand it is not so nice if every country wear some type of clothes.</P>
      <P>Finaly about my oppinion I wish we are going to dress us more as in the past with nature matrial, we most think more about the eviorment and leave closer to the earth.</P>
