      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing in order to give you some further information that you enquired for the Camp California.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment. I am allowed to take holiday only in July.</P>
      <P>Concerning accommodation, I would prefer to stay in log cabins. Log cabins are bigger, more stable and usually more comfortable than tents.</P>
      <P>As requested, I have choosed two activities - sailing and surfing. I am quite experienced in surfing - I have participated some competitions - whereas not at all experienced in sailing.</P>
      <P>I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp. Also, I would like to know if there is going to be qualified instructor for activities since I am a beginning in sailing as mentioned before.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>Kan Seo</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>How are you? Thanks for your last letter. It was great to hear from you.</P>
      <P>I'm sorry I haven't written before, but as you know, I've been very busy because I was helping at a pop concert last month.</P>
      <P>I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I helped people setting and decorating the concert hall which was great help for my major subject - You know that my subject is design. I also had to distribute the flyers.</P>
      <P>What I particularly enjoyed was meeting the famous musicians I have been dreaming to see. The day I shaked their hands, I though I will never forget that day.</P>
      <P>Write son and let me know what you have been doing.</P>
      <P>Lots and lots of kisses,</P>
