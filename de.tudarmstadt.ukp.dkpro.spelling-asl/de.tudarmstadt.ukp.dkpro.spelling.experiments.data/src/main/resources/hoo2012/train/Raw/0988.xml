      <P>Dear Mrs Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am delighted to answer you back to give you more informations about me since I have won such a nice price.</P>
      <P>As I have already planned my holiday for August, I will only be available in July, after my exams.</P>
      <P>It would be nice to have a tent because I have never been camping and would like to try it, at least once.</P>
      <P>The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much. My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it.</P>
      <P>I do not have any idea of what the weather is like and what kind of clothes I should take. Also, I would like to know if it is better to exchange my money in England or in the USA.</P>
      <P>I hope you will be able to answer these questions.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Like most of the girls I enjoy shopping but it can be either a great moment or a nightmare.</P>
      <P>What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering around and looking at everything. Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment.</P>
      <P>The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items.</P>
      <P>You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I would say that to have a nice moment shopping you had better to save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient.</P>
