      <P>Dear Sir/Madam:</P>
      <P>I am writing you to show my disagree about the musical show 'Over the rainbow.</P>
      <P>First, I am very dissapointed with the starring. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike.</P>
      <P>Also, the musical did not start at 19.30, it started forty-five minutes later. That is why, it finished later and I arrived late to a basketball match.</P>
      <P>Another thing is that there were not any discounts in the entrance fee.</P>
      <P>Finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because it was sunday. It is closed all sundays, you have to say it.</P>
      <P>That is why I will be pleased if you give my money back.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
    </PART>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why I didn't want to tell him that I had failed my natural science final exam. I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed, before we were on holidays, they will cancelled the trip to Africa.</P>
      <P>But, I need to say it to someone, so I told it to Pat. The next day, all the class knew it. I wasn't too worried because if someones is going to see my parents, I would tell them before not talk about the exams.</P>
      <P>But, when my mother was talking with Pat's mother and she mentioned it, my mother cancelled the trip to Africa.</P>
      <P>It wasn't Pat fault, it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and also, I knew that Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
