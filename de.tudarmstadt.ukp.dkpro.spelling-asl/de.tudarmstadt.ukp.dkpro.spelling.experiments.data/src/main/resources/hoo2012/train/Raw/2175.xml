      <P>Dear Mrs Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I'm writting to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that Camp.</P>
      <P>I'm going to give you all the information you need from me.</P>
      <P>I only can travel I July, because it is when I stop playing basketball to rest before starting the new season. I don't mind staying wherever you want me to. However, I prefer log cabins to tents. They're more comfortable.</P>
      <P>According to the activities I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal me much, but I'm quite good at Golf. I like surfing and playing tennis, such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it.</P>
      <P>there'are no more questions.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I'm writting to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday.</P>
      <P>It was such a beautiful night! Unforgetable.</P>
      <P>I had always dreamt of being near "The Cranberies", but I had never thought that the dream could became reallity.</P>
      <P>During the afternoon, Tim and me spent the hours before the concer laying on the park next to the sport hall where the concert was to be held.</P>
      <P>AT seven o'clock on the dot we went there for starting queueing. We bought the tickets and then we sit down to rest.</P>
      <P>After a few minutes the dream happened: Kare - the guitarrist - appeared over there. At first we both thought we were dreaming but when we realised it was true we went there and ask him some questions. And then we bring his guitar for him. It was great to help him.</P>
      <P>Finally he said how thankful he was and alowed us to stay with them till the concert started.</P>
      <P>That's all.</P>
      <P>I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Aladdin</P>
