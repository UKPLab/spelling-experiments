      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>I like shopping but I had a bad experience about my recent shopping. I went out for shopping and to get some ideas about new brand computers and products. First of all I went to a local shop but I couldn't find enough selection of products.</P>
      <P>Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card. It was a nightmare there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless.</P>
      <P>As soon as possible I phoned to my bank for cancelation of my credit card but they had already used it. it costs me about Â£500. This experience has changed my shopping habit, now I do all my shopping on the internet. But I'm not sure how it is safe. But you must be always award against to pickpokets.</P>
