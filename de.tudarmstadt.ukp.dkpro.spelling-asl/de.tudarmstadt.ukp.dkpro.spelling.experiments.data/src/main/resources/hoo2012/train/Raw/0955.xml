      <P>Dear Jane Clark,</P>
      <P>I went to the "International Arts Festival" on 21-22 November. The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for the next year's festival.</P>
      <P>Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries. I suggest you to increase this number for the next year. By this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will point on is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? Last thing that I will say is "one reasonably-priced weekend ticket". It was very good idea. I hope you will make the same thing next year.</P>
      <P>These are the my suggestions. I hope you will listen my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year in the festival.</P>
      <P> Sincerely</P>
