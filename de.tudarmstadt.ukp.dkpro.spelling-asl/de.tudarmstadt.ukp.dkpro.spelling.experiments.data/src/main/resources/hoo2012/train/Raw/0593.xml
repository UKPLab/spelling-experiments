      <P>I would prefer tents because I have never stay in tents before and I am wondering how it is going to be like And among these activities I am choosing basketball and swimming. Basketball because I am very good at it, swimming because I like to swim very much but I'm not a very good swimmer. And finally I would like to ask you some questions. My first question is about clothes; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us? and How much money do we need to take?</P>
