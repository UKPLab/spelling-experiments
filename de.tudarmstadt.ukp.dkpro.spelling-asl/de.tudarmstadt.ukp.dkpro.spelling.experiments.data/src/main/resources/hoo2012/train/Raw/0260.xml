      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show "Over the Rainbow", wich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show.</P>
      <P>The first problem concerned the main actor of the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.</P>
      <P>The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the public, including me, was forced to wait for fourty five minutes.</P>
      <P>It was also written in the show's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets. However, there was not any.</P>
      <P>The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear from you in the near future.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything.</P>
      <P>One day, I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly.</P>
      <P>I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart. Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love.</P>
      <P>The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmous saddness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately brake up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore.</P>
      <P>Now, unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend or a best friend, all because Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
