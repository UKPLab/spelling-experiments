      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>Last week I stayed in London for holidays. During my stay in that beautiful city, I thought it was a good idea to go to the theatre to enjoy a Musical show, so I decided to go to your theatre to see "over the Rainbow".</P>
      <P>It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who was in the theatre.</P>
      <P>First of all, I was looking forward to see one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a diferent actor instead of him in spite of his name was writen in the advertisement.</P>
      <P>In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m. but, in fact, it began at eight fifteen. I also, found out that no discounts were available. In spite of it was said in the advertisement.</P>
      <P>Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cooker has had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables.</P>
      <P>In the advertisement there's no mention about getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give it back to me.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
      <P>Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village in the southern cost of Spain with my friend Pat.</P>
      <P>We usually went to the beach to have a bath and to enjoy the fantastic whether in that part of Spain during the summer.</P>
      <P>One day we found out a beautiful little beach next to the big one where some people were taking a sunbath and some children were playing football in the sand.</P>
      <P>At it was so beautiful, we decided to come back to the beach at night to see the moon, the see and the stars.</P>
      <P>When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two persons doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, at the end, we saw that they had robbed a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell it to anybody. It was our secret.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately Pat explained the story to a friend of us and I don't know how, but the robbers knew that we had seen all they had been doing. So, now we are in danger because of that.</P>
