      <P>Mr./Mrs Manager,</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about a musical show I went one week ago.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy the cheapest and worst seat available. As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the Â£10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.</P>
      <P>Sincerely,</P>
    </PART>

      <P>How has modern technology changed my daily life?</P>
      <P>Well, it's pretty simple to answer this.</P>
      <P>Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer, I didn't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games.</P>
      <P>The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them, I kept on stucked in front of the screen.</P>
      <P>Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC. After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed. I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web. My daily life would be harder without modern technology.</P>
