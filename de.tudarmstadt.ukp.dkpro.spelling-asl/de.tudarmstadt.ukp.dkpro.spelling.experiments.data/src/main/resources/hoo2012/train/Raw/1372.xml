      <P>Lausanne, the 20th of May 2000</P>
      <P>Dear M. Smith,</P>
      <P>My name is Marie Bouchard, I come from Switzerland. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend. On Thursday, the 3rd of May 2000, we went to your theatre to see "Over the rainbow". Unfortunately, we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre.</P>
      <P>Firstly, we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts as it's written on your advertisement. Surprisily, there were no discounds.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!!</P>
      <P>Thirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement?</P>
      <P>In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!! Nothing was serious. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful.</P>
      <P>I sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back. In advance, thank you.</P>
      <P>I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre.</P>
      <P>Sincerely yours</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When her best friend, Scala, asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she's pregnant, Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala's husband got the surprise.</P>
      <P>The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village. She's a secretary in an office. Everybody knows everybody.</P>
      <P>Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husband too.</P>
      <P>It was a Friday suny afternoon, Scala was really excited to tell her the new. Despite she knew that Pat couldn't keep secret but for this time she was confident maybe too.</P>
      <P>Just after Scala told her the new, Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery, to tell that Scala is pregnant.</P>
      <P>As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came and bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said "Congratulations for the new baby."</P>
      <P>He was so amazed and asked to repeat. She just thought it would be a secret, she came really embarassed.</P>
      <P>When he went back to his house, his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it wasn't a surprise! Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret.</P>
