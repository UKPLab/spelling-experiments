      <P>Dear Miss Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writting to reply your letter and comenicate my aceptance of the first prize in your Competition.</P>
      <P>This summer, I am available on July because on Agust my family and I are going to go to Canada and on September I will go back at university. If there is no chance to go to California on July, I could wait untill next summer.</P>
      <P>About accommodation, I would like to a long cabin because last year I had an accident and my back is enjure, so sleeping in a tent it would be painful for me.</P>
      <P>I play basketball at university and my level is quite good but I am really enjoying is being a referee. Due to my back enjure, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit, it would be a good aidea to be a referee. I would like to swim everyday if is able. Althoung swimming is so bored, it would be a good help for curing my back.</P>
      <P>Could you please let me know where will I eate? if will there be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it? how many money you think will I need for those two weeks? And please could you give me details about how does the weather like there and what type the clothes will I have to bringh?</P>
      <P>Looking forwards to hearing from you</P>
      <P>Yours sincerily</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>It was brilliant! I had the best month in my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard, I worked 12 hours per day but alwalys with funny people. My job was cleaning the ground after the concert; "it was very dirty". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course, I had not to pay for getting in.</P>
      <P>I felt in love with a beautiful girl "Calen", she is from Spain and was selling "hot dogs". She will come to Liverpool next week and I'll put her up. Probably she'll come with a friend if you want you can enjoy us.</P>
      <P>Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've done a new friends and I know that in the concert there isn't any drunk just funny and wonderful people.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help in "Doctor Meesee" that is the best concert in the world, I hope you will come there. You have to save up money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..).</P>
      <P>Love</P>
