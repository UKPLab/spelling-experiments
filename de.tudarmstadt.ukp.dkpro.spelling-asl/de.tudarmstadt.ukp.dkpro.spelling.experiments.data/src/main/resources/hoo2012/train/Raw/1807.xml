      <P>Dear Ms Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have just received a letter from you and I am really happy to hear the news that I have won first prize in the competition. I would like to tell you something about what you asked me in the letter.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin. I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for few days but not over 3 days. It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin.</P>
      <P>Regarding with two activities I will choose swimming and photography. I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year. On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college.</P>
      <P>Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money. Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cram, sweets and beverage very much especially in the summer. Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Shin Parade</P>

      <P>Do you think shopping is always enjoyable? Well, it might be true but I think it depends on the situation.</P>
      <P>When you do shopping, you can see various products even very extraordinary thing. You can also see more graceful and fine thing. You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits to you.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want. Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing. If shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even varys with people whom you shop with.</P>
