      <P>Dear Mister Muller,</P>
      <P>I address this letter to you because as the manager of "The Circle Theatre" I hold you responsible for the most disappointing evening in a theatre I had in years. I went to see the evening performance of your production of "Over the Rainbow" on saturday the 2nd of June.</P>
      <P>At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were availlable. I bought one of the most expensive tickets.</P>
      <P>Although the show was scheduled to start at 19.30h, it did not begin until 20.15h.</P>
      <P>To my greatest disappointement Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement. After the show I had to find out that the theatre restaurant, that had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party. Contrary to your advertisement I had no "perfect evening out" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 Â£ I paid for my ticket.</P>
      <P>faithfully yours</P>
      <P>....</P>

      <P>Best detective stories of Agatha Christie</P>
      <P>That exciting stories always describe people in difficult situations is true of Agatha Christie's "Witness for the prosecution".</P>
      <P>This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who inherited her whole fortune to him. He had befriended her without telling her that he was married.</P>
      <P>The accused is defended by a famous lawyer who tells his wife that a loving wife's confirmation of her husband's alibi will not convince the jury</P>
      <P>To help her husband she works out a plan: She is willing to be witness for the prosecution and states that her husband has not been with her at the time the crime was committed. She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations. The plan works: The jury thinks that the wife is a notorious liar and her husband is found innocent. After the trial the lawyer is told that the man was indeed guilty.</P>
