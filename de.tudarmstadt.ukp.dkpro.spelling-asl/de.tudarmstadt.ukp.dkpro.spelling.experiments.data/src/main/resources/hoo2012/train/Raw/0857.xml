      <P>First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during this month.</P>
      <P>Secondly, if you don't mind, I would prefer to sleep in a tent. Although it is not very comfortable, I like camping very much.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I am very interested in swimming and also climbing. I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on. I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city.</P>

      <P>I have asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>In fact, to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons:</P>
      <P>Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes, which you don't really need.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying, so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially I am depressed, nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet.</P>
