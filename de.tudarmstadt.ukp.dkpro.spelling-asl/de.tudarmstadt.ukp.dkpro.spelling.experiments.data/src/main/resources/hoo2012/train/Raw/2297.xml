      <P>Dear Sir or Madam:</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day in your theatre.</P>
      <P>I am afraid but I think that the show was not as good as I expected: the reason were many.</P>
      <P>- Danny brook did not play and I wanted to see him.</P>
      <P>- the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30. Please check your times because many people had to leave at the middle of the show.</P>
      <P>- When the musical finished I was terrible hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisiment said that it would be open.</P>
      <P>In conclusion that evening was not "my perfect evening out" so I want you to refund me the money.</P>
      <P>I look forward to your reply.</P>
      <P>Yours Faithfully,</P>
      <P>Manuel Juan Sargo</P>

      <P>The modern technology has changed my life in many difents ways: But this "modern technology" has advantages and disadvantages. In on hand we have the advantages the new technology permits you many things like fly, see in the dark, or even save your life when you are almost dead. But in the other hand we have the disadvantages. The technology makes your life easier but, until when? For example, the car was developed by the modern technology, it makes your life easier but also "dangerous". Why? Because too many cars mean too much CO2 in the air. And all people know that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kind of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give and permit you may things wich would be impossible in other times but also gives you many problems.</P>
