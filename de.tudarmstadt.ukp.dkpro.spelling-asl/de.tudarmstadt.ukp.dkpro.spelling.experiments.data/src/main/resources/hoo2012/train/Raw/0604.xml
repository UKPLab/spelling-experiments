      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing concerning the journey I have won in your competition.</P>
      <P>First of all I will try to answer your questions.</P>
      <P>For me it is only possible to go to the USA in July. The reason for this is that I have to work in August and from September to June I have to go to school.</P>
      <P>I would prefer long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me.</P>
      <P>The activities you offer are really interesting. I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have an own camera.</P>
      <P>In spite of this, I have got all equipement I need for the activity painting and I am painting very well.</P>
      <P>Could you please tell me if I will need some extra money for the two activities.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to know if I should take any warm clothes with me.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>It was nice to hear from you recently.</P>
      <P>I am writing to tell you about my work at the pop concert.</P>
      <P>I went there a 10 o'clock in the morning. Then a young man told me what to do. First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position. It was really hard work.</P>
      <P>At one o'clock I had a break. At this time I promised that I would never do this awful job again. The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon I was sitting around, waiting for the pop groups. Then at five o'clock my favourite band "Tristania" arrived.</P>
      <P>I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later.</P>
      <P>In the end I was happy that I had done this job. It was really a wonderful day.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together the next year.</P>
      <P>Give my regards to your family.</P>
      <P>Best wishes,</P>
