      <P>Dear Helen:</P>
      <P>I am very please to receive you letter, and read all the question you ask me, now, I answer the question.</P>
      <P>I would like to go travel in July, because at that moment, is stay my summer holiday, so I had more freedom time, and I want to live in tents more than log cabin, because when we live in a tent, usually we are in the countryside. at that moment, I think it should be suitable for me.</P>
      <P>Do you know, I am amuzing to play tennis? I am tennis first team in my school, so I can show my highly tennis skill during the holidays, and I can play Basketball as well, but not very good, you can say I only know how to play.</P>
      <P>Do you mind tell me what is the weather , when I during the holiday, what kind the money I should bring with me and what language I should know in there?</P>
      <P>Please write back. take care</P>

      <P>What do you think about shopping?</P>
      <P>VeryFungirl friendromatic, but do you know is not always like this.</P>
      <P>When you go to shopping with your girl friend, she want to watch every clothes in the shopping centre, but you are not interesting of that, romatic, no! I think you will feel boring.</P>
      <P>If you interestingofhaddiffence, so at the last you both two will feel unhappy or angry to each other.</P>
      <P>If you go out with your same sex friend that should be fine but everytime go to the same place, everyone will feel boring.</P>
      <P>Shopping is enjoyable, but not very offer, so don't say to everyone shopping is always enjoyable!</P>
