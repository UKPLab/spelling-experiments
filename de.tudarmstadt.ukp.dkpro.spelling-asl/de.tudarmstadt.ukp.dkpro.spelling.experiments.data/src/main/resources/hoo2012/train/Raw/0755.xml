      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing in reply to your letter in wich you told me I won the first prize. It is the first time I won a prize!</P>
      <P>As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area.</P>
      <P>It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team, since I used to play it in my school's team and I think I'm pretty good at it. Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport.</P>
      <P>I'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot by this time of the year and if I should bring any money.</P>
      <P>I have butterflies of excitement and I'am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>Carlitos Andrade</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay. However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family.</P>
      <P>Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. Its normal to have spending sprees. Everyone had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid.</P>
      <P>Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time. On the other hand, if you think that you'll be on the red, I'd better stay at home.</P>
