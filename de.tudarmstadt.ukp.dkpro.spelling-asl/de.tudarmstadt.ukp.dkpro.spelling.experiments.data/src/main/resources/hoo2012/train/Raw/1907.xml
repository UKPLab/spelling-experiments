      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have seen your letter for Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now.</P>
      <P>First of all, you state in the letter that the accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I would prefer to stay in tents because I like being in contact with the nature life.</P>
      <P>Secondly, from the list of activities that you are also state in the letter I would prefer swimming because when I was a child I practised this sport for 8 years. In addition, I would prefer photography too because I love taking photos.</P>
      <P>Finally, it would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of clothes I must be taken and how much I will spend during the stay at the Camp.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you</P>
      <P>Yours sincerelly</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Many thanks for your last letter. I'm sorry I haven't written for so long but as you can imagine I've been pretty busy with my studies.</P>
      <P>Anyway, the reason I'm writing is that you asked me about my experience with the most famous pop group in America: "Mana"</P>
      <P>Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help in the event. First I didn't accept but finally she conviced me. It was the most excited experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drinks. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepare orange juices.</P>
      <P>It was grateful because I knew a lot of people and the most important person was Alex, the baterist of the group. You know he is my love! He's good-looking.</P>
      <P>I enjoyed very much.</P>
      <P>Give my love to your family</P>
      <P>Write soon</P>
      <P>Love,</P>
