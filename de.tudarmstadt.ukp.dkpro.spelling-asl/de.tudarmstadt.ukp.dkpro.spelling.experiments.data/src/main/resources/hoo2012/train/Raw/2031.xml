      <P>Dear Mrs Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter. It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you wanted.</P>
      <P>Firstly, you asked me about the period I'd prefer to travel: For me, the only solution is July, because I've already something planned in August.</P>
      <P>Concerning the accommodation, I'd prefer to spend my nights in a log cabin, because I've great difficulty sleeping in a tent.</P>
      <P>You also mentionned the activities I'll be able to do. I chose tennis and golf. Althoug I've been playing tennis for five years, I can't say I'm a very good player. And I'm even worse at golf, because I've never been playing it before. But I enjoy discovering new activities! In addition to this, I would be grateful if you could send me information on these few details: what kind of clothes is required? How is the weather at this period of the year? And should I take some money with me? How much?</P>
      <P>I hope you will be able to answer my questions.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Hermine Damien</P>

      <P>"Cry Freedom"</P>
      <P>If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. "Cry Freedom", from John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice?</P>
      <P>Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries.</P>
      <P>However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, love of justice, fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes, and "Cry Freedom" is one of them.</P>
      <P>To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story.</P>
