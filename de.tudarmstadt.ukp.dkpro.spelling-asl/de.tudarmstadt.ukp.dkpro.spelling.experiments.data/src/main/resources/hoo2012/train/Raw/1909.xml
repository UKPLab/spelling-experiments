      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan:</P>
      <P>Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you the further informations you asked for:</P>
      <P>I only have two months of vacation that are July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July.</P>
      <P>I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you:</P>
      <P>Do I need to bring particular clothing like a surfing suit, for instance? Is any "pocket money" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards?</P>
      <P>Best Regards</P>
      <P>Chi Chen</P>

      <P>Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money for yourself or people you appreciate is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.</P>
      <P>You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier.</P>
      <P>Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into more frustration and tiredness.</P>
      <P>So there are several plausible reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
