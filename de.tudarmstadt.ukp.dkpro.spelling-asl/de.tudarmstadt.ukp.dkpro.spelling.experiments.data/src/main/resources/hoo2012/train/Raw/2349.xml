      <P>Dear Manager of the Circle Theatre</P>
      <P>I recently had a week's holiday in London. During my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see your musical show called 'Over the rainbow'. It was actually very disappointing and I have to say that I want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and I rally do think it was not the perfect evening out.</P>
      <P>Here are the problems of your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late.</P>
      <P>The price of ticket was another problem. Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available. I did not get discount. I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show.</P>
      <P>I really do think you need to organise your show a bit more carefully so you do not make these mistakes in future and it will be kind of you if you give my money back.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>
      <P>Ring T Lun</P>

      <P>How has modern technology changed your daily life?</P>
      <P>I believe that modern technology has changed a lot of people's daily life. My daily life also got affected by modern technology a lot.</P>
      <P>The modern technology which changed my daily life most is a personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course works in the computer.</P>
      <P>The main advantage of modern technology is getting more informations in shorter time. I can go on internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones. I don't have to go to library and read hundred's of books to find informations anymore.</P>
      <P>I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various newses and I don't have to go to football pitches to see how the players are playing.</P>
      <P>There are, of course some disadvantages. Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology. I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere. There are plenty of trains and buses. I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit. I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot.</P>
      <P>I think modern techonology has changed my daily life a lot and I hope it will develop even more to change my life even more.</P>
