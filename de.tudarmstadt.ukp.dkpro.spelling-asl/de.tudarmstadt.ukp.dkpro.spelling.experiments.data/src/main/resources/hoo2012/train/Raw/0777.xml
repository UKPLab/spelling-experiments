      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan:</P>
      <P>I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your requests.</P>
      <P>First of all, it would be suitable for me to travel in July only, because that is when I am on holiday from work.</P>
      <P>Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be unapropriate for me.</P>
      <P>I would prefer golf and surfing. I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasent to do so. About surfing, I am an amateur at it. I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend me to take. I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there. Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerately,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim:</P>
      <P>Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert.</P>
      <P>It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began.</P>
      <P>What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him.</P>
      <P>Bye! see you soon,</P>
