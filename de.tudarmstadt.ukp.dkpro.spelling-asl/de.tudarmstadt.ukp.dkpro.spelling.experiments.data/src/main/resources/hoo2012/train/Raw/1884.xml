      <P>17th June 2000</P>
      <P>The Manager</P>
      <P>The Circle Theatre</P>
      <P>My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially of the funny actor "Danny Brook". When we saw your advertisement in the "Evening Post" we made a reservation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that actors have been changed at the last minute.</P>
      <P>In addition, there was no discount available, the show started at 20:15 and not at 19:30. After that, your restaurant was closed whitout reason.</P>
      <P>We are very disappointed. It was not a "perfect evening out" but "a dreadful evening out".</P>
      <P>It would be nice from you if you could refund us some money or send us two new ticket.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
