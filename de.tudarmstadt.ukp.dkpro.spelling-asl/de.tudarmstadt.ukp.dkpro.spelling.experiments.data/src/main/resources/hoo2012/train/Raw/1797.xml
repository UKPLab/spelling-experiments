      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writting to you about the show. I was very disappointed after this show. I would like to have my money back. At first the show started at 10.15, and it should be at 19.30.</P>
      <P>After your show I wanted to visit my friends, and because of it, I didn't do it.</P>
      <P>Also, you wrote about discounts, but it's not true! The woman, who sold a ticket was very roud with me, actually she started swearing at me.</P>
      <P>During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit restaurant, it's a pity, but restaurant was closed because it was too late.</P>
      <P>And, I forget to say about actor, I didn't enjoy them.</P>
      <P>So, I hope I will get my money back, it was very disappointing evening out in my life! I hope you understand me!</P>
      <P>your sincerely</P>
      <P>Ongelina</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but any way I trusted him. It's happened 3 months ago, and during this months I am very upset.</P>
      <P>I have a friend, his name Peter, he is my best friend.</P>
      <P>Two days later in the morning, the policeman came to Peter... So, now my best friend is prisoner. All the time I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in the prison 5 years. By the way I don't see Pat about one year. Perhaps, he moved into another town. It's good that he far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny...</P>
