      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to complain about the musical show which I've recently seen at your theatre.</P>
      <P>I was enthusiastic about the special event. The advertisement shew two actors but I was surprised to see as the main caracter a different person. As well as this, to my horror, the performance didn't start at 19.30 but forthy five minutes later. In addition to this, the theatre restaurant was closed for lack of servants. No discounts were available!</P>
      <P>So, I'm sure you will understand why I'm feeling so annoyed by the whole incident. I hope you will give me back the prize of my ticket!</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
