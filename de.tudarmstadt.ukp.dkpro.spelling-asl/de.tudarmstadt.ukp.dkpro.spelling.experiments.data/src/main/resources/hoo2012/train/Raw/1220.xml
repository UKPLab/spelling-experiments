      <P>Dear Madam:</P>
      <P>I just receive your letter with the good news. I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June.</P>
      <P>For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy.</P>
      <P>I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities. I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers.</P>
      <P>Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget.</P>
      <P>Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>In my opinion shopping sometimes is really boring specially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food.</P>
      <P>On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family. I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost.</P>
      <P>In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decissions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depends on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested to please.</P>
