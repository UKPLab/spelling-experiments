      <P>Dear sir,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday. In fact it was quite different from the one I had expected to see. First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the brochure. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed.</P>
      <P>I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even if I had read on the brochure that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed.</P>
      <P>Thanks to you, I've had the most dreadful experience of my life.</P>
      <P>If you don't give me back my money I'll never go to your theatre again.</P>
      <P>Write back soon</P>

      <P>As Modern technology is changing the world rapidly I think we are all involved in the revolution it's causing.</P>
      <P>New technologies have affected people's way of living for ages, by offering them better tools to survive</P>
      <P>I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about Internet. I think that Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for exemple in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net.</P>
      <P>I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I'm really astounded by its way of changing my daily life.</P>
