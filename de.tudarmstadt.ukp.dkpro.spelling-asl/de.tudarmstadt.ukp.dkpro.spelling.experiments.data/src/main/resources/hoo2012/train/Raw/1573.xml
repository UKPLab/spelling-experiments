      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am writing this letter, concerning the information you have asked me to give you.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank you, for giving me the chance to visit Camp California.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, my exams at school will have finished up to the middle of June. To be honest, I would like to spend some days with my family, before I go to California. Therefore, it would be better to go there in July. July should be the hotest month! The best season for holidays.</P>
      <P>About the accomodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me the holidays with my family.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful to tell me how much money I will need with me.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I am really impressed from your interest about my experience from the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and things have to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Anyway, I've enjoyed it very much! It was the best experience I've ever had in my whole life. I was trying to be with the singers all the time. It was fantastic. I wanted to touch them, as the only way to convince myself that I was with them.</P>
      <P>I didn't really have to do anything special. I should just take care of them, serving some drinks and food during the rehearshals.</P>
      <P>That's the advantage of being a volunteer. You get good experiences which you'll never forget!</P>
      <P>You have to try once in your life and if you don't like, don't do it again.</P>
      <P>Regards,</P>
