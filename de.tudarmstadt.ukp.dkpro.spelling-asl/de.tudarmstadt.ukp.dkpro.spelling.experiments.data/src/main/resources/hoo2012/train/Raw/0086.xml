      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to complain about the service you'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre.</P>
      <P>I've read your advertisement and it didn't say the truth. There weren't any discount available as you'd assured in the add. I think you should check the information before print it!</P>
      <P>I arrived at the right time (19.30) that evening but the play, which was 'Over The Rainbow', started almost an hour later. And nobody told me why!</P>
      <P>When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one wasn't good at all.</P>
      <P>I couldn't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations. Why didn't you say something about it?</P>
      <P>I didn't have the 'perfect evening out' you'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible.</P>
      <P>Please answer my letter as soon as possible. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>Marcella, Scalia C.</P>

      <P>'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life?'</P>
      <P>This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain you how.</P>
      <P>I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games.</P>
      <P>When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial to do my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job.</P>
      <P>One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one.</P>
      <P>I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't survive. The modern technology is better now than what it used to be.</P>
      <P>What do you think about this? I'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view, haven't they? Now I would like to have your point of view.</P>
