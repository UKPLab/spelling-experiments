      <P>Dear Mrs Ryan,</P>
      <P>Thank you a lot for your letter, I am very happy of having won the competition. I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to. I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin.</P>
      <P>I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography, I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to know what sort of clothes do advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid , do I need to take a lot of money with me?</P>
      <P>Thank you a lot for all these details.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Jasmine Martin</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>I have a lot of different things to tell you about what happened at the concert. It was really an amazing experience.</P>
      <P>First, I had to spend all the day before the concert in the field where it took place, I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments. I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood.</P>
      <P>I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage.</P>
      <P>As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group. That was the best.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours,</P>
      <P>Brenda</P>
