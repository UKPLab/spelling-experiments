      <P>Dear Ms. Ryan</P>
      <P>I am writing in response to the letter, which I had yesterday. I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give details, which you would like to know.</P>
      <P>First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only on July. Because I have to work all year except one month holiday on July.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would be appreciate if I could stay in log cabins at Camp. I feel that it would be fabulos places with western design.</P>
      <P>Most of all, I am really interested in doing two activities. I am very good at Tennis. However, I haven't had any idea about sailing. So, I would like to try both of them.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I would be grateful if I could have following informations.</P>
      <P>I would like to know about clothes, which are suitable for activities. As well as that, I wonder if I have to take some money for extra activities and few more things.</P>
      <P>Thank you for time and attention.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>yours sincerely</P>
      <P>Jae Hwa. Kim.</P>

      <P>There was a meeting to talk about a video about daily life at our school.</P>
      <P>It was thought that a normal, regular lesson, 3 optional lessons and a great deal of activities should be filmed.</P>
      <P>Refering to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming. I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting, photography should be included. It can show how much students are enjoying their life in our school.</P>
      <P>As well as that, if we filmed famous students and teachers in our school, it would be a fantastic video.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, students can learn English from wide activities as well as lessons. That's why they prefer to film a lot of activities.</P>
