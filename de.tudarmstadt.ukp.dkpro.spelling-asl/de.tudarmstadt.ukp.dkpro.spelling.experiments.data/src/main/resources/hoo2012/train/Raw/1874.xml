      <P>Dear Madam,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been at. I also hope, that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it "international" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (mentioned to be "from around the world") were from only six countries. Maybe the eason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain, why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most. I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year.</P>
      <P>I also thank you for the excellent idea of one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in.</P>
      <P>My suggestion for next year's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer!</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>Dear Friend,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it. If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them in a nutshell.</P>
      <P>We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often.</P>
      <P>At home I don't have many rules either. I must wash the dishes from time to time (I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty) and clean our house.</P>
      <P>I don't think there is anything I'd like to change. I'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours!</P>
      <P>Your,</P>
