      <P>Dear Jane Clark</P>
      <P>Hello!</P>
      <P>My name is Yuna Kimber who attended this annual International Arts Festival.</P>
      <P>I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpul for you to prepare for the next festival to you.</P>
      <P>First of all, I appreicate you for organizing such an exciting festival. It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself to this festival so much.</P>
      <P>By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them just from only six countries.</P>
      <P>And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt stuffy.</P>
      <P>I hope you'll get much bigger concerts hall next year.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, plays and films were excellent.</P>
      <P>I expect that much more various kinds of plays and films will be on next year.</P>
      <P>Finally, I'd like to mention reasonably-priced weekend ticket. It was brillient, because if I had to pay all things each I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me. Thank you very much about that.</P>
      <P>I hope it will be helpful and useful for you.</P>
      <P>Bye for now</P>
      <P>Faithfully yours</P>

      <P>Long time ago, there were two brothers, whose parents were dead. Their parents were rich, so when they passed away they left a lot of money.</P>
      <P>By the way, the elder brother, Nolbu was a so greedy man.</P>
      <P>He didn't want to share the money with his brother, Hungbu so he took all of the money, and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything.</P>
      <P>Hungbu had nothing but his twelve family.</P>
      <P>But, even if he was so poor, he was so good and had a lot of affection about the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them.</P>
      <P>But, Nolbu always made people annoyed, and enjoyed other people's misfortune.</P>
      <P>One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer county during the winter. He cured the bird to fly with love, and the bird was able to fly.</P>
      <P>The following year, when the bird returned his house, he gave him a message. It was a kind of map that showed the place for a lot of money which robbers hid.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hungbu became much richer than Nolbu, and he lived happily with the money helping the poor.</P>
      <P>People belive that the bird was sent by heaven.</P>
      <P>This story happened a long time ago.</P>
