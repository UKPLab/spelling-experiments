      <P>Dear Helen Ryan, the competition Organiser,</P>
      <P>I have recently recieved your letter that I have won the first prize in the competition. It was very fortuanate of me.</P>
      <P>I would like to go to Camp California in the USA only in July as it is my summer holidays. It will be convenient for me then because I have two months holiday.</P>
      <P>I would like to do Tennis and Photography. I am in the team for tennis at school and I have played against different other schools before. I also enjoy photography. I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E. so it would be very helpful for me to practise.</P>
      <P>About the accommodation at the Camp, I would like to stay in tents because I love to be outside and I like dangerous adventures. I can also then wake up in the morning and take photographs of the wonderful sceneries.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask you about what kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I have bring. Will there be any shops? Please could you send me an itenerary of the trip? Thank you very much.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends which normally is the only appropreaite time! Not only shops are crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queue. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side of 'shopping'.</P>
      <P>I, personally enjoy shopping very much. I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them. I find that shopping is a very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath.</P>
      <P>I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future, there will be no more crowded streets because of the 'internet' which you can order onlines. Maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future!</P>
      <P>We all just have to wait and see...</P>
