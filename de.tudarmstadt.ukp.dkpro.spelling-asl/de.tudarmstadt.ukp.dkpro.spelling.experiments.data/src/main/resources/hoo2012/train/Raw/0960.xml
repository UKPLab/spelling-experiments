      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I am writing to complete about my being to the Circle Theatre during my last week's holiday in London. I have seen a musical show and it was not my favourite time.</P>
      <P>I am confusing because of playing different actor in place Danny Brook. Secendly, the show started at 20.15. This is why I was feeling invited to your restaurant after show. Unfortunately, I found closed doors and any information about the reason. I would like to add that being a student I find discounts very important for my budget. Neither without any reason it was not available.</P>
      <P>I will gladfull if you will send my money back.</P>
      <P>Your faithfull,</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason whe we were horrible troubles with police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk with us.</P>
      <P>Let's back to the beginig of this story. I with my friends had holidays and decided to spend a few days on a "island". We called this place like this, because it was a land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning on a land - to our town. There was no light during nights so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was a walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered a gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place when robber keept stolen gold from bank. We found the solution of this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but...</P>
      <P>I think you are able to imagine what was happen later.</P>
