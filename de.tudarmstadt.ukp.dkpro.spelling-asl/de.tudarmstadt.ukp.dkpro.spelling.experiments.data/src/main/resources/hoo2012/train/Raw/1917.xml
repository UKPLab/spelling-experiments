      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have received your letter today and I would to thank you for the first price.</P>
      <P>The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communication firm and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. For the accommodation at camp, I prefer in the log cabins, because few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent, it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet so for this fact, I choose the log cabins.</P>
      <P>For the two activites that I chose are at first swimming, I am in the Swimming Team and I must go two times per week to entretain me because I have competition every weekend. My second choice, it is Basketball. I have played basketball at school and I was one of the best player after that, I decided to coach a team but I should stop because I have started swimming competition.</P>
      <P>For these two weeks, what kind of clothes I must take? It is including the transport and travel, but for the food and extra hobbies I must take some money. Could you tell me approximatively </P>
      <P>Your sincerely</P>
      <P>M. Bruni</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>How are you? I'm fine.</P>
      <P>You know last month I helped at a pop concert as like security. It was a very good experience.</P>
      <P>The concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepear the scene with the musicians.</P>
      <P>After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and you know it was incredibale because some people slept all the night in front of the stadium to be in the front row. There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman. I saw old people, child.... and for me it was very strange and it was very interessting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang, it was fantastic. If I had an other opportunity to do that I think that I will do.</P>
      <P>Write me as soon as possible. </P>
