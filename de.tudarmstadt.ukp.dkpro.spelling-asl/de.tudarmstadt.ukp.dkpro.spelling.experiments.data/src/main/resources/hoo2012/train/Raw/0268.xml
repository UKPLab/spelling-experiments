      <P>Dear Ms Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am really pleased hearing from you, I won the prize. So I can go camping for two weeks. It must be great.</P>
      <P>As regards your questions, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am a student and my summer holiday will start on 27th June so I can go to U.S.A in July and I prefer staying in tents because I have never experienced camping in the tent. So exciting!</P>
      <P>And I would like to have chances to play tennis and go swimming. In case of swimming, I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis before 3 weeks. However, I am very enjoying playing tennis.</P>
      <P>Further, I have a question. Actually I have never gone camping so I really have no idea about that. I wonder which clothes are suitable for your camping. And How about the money? Do you think if there is some occasions to spend money or not? I am really expecting going camping</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>
      <P>JAE KWAI</P>
