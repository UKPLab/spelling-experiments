      <P>Nowedays famous people don't have an easy life. They are always attacted by naughty journalists, which have aspiration to earn big money for writing an extremaly good report, or article.</P>
      <P>To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly. In addition we are fascinated in their marriage, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known. By chosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look like.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, their life has no privaty. In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxiously and lonely. They are always under high pressure in their every-day life, because they are afraid of being recognise.</P>
      <P>Some people may argue, but I think, that politicions and films-stars belong to the public. In conclusion, I belive that we have right to be informed about their life, providing that journalists respect some important rules.</P>
