      <P>Dir Madam!</P>
      <P>I'm realy enjoyed I won your competition!</P>
      <P>I'll give you nessesserly information about me.</P>
      <P>The most suitable time for me is Jule because in August I intend to go in the countryside, where I have a small farm. In September my school starts a new study year. So, because of that I can only then.</P>
      <P>I'd like to stay in the log cabins, because I don't like wet places like tends after rain.</P>
      <P>You ofer me a lot of activities. I play basketball and tennis very well. I went to try surfing and climbing because I've never done it.</P>
      <P>I've got also two questions. How much money I need to stay at Camp California and what kind of clothes I should take with me?</P>
      <P>Please let me know!</P>
      <P>Regards!</P>

      <P>Dear Kim!</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter, which arrived this morning. I'm glad you're doing well.</P>
      <P>You'd like to know how was the Top-Pop Concert, which I helped to organise last month. It was absolutlly great! I was responsible about a security of one of the sectors. I gave information about correct ways to another places like tooletes and medical points. I was also asked about a timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, knifes and so on in bags. Although I worked I watched the concert. I was big fun! People danced, screamed and sung with a singer. I looked very carefully at organisation of the event, you know I'm interestsing in it.</P>
      <P>OK. I'd better stop now because I'm going to go to a library.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hear some news from you!</P>
      <P>Take care!</P>
