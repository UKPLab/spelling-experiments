      <P>Dear madame</P>
      <P>I'm very surprised about the good news and I'm sure I'll really have a good time in California.</P>
      <P>I'm happy to answer to your questions.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to travel in July because my boss won't let me free in August.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to stay in tents because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can. Regarding to the activities, I choose swimming and tennis.</P>
      <P>I'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian See. I don't think I'll have the chance of doing it again in the future.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, I'm an absolute beginner in playing tennis and I'm not fit in running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time.</P>
      <P>There is something I would like to ask you. What kind of clothes am I supposed to bring with me? And what about money? Should I bring cash or a credit card is all I will need?</P>
      <P>And what about sanitary precautions?</P>
      <P>I can't?look forward to start this adventure.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerily</P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do. In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions just like the other women do. When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and harder to find it.</P>
      <P>I see a lot of pretty things but I have to quit the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me.</P>
      <P>And if this is a problem to me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) should feel.</P>
      <P>Often they must go in special shops to by their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life.</P>
      <P>Will this ever change?</P>
      <P>I hope so, but, in the meantime, I'm on a diet.</P>
