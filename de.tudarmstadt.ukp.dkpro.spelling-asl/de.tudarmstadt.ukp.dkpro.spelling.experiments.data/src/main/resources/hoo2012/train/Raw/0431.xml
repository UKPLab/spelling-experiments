      <P>Dear Mrs. Ryan,</P>
      <P>in your letter I received a few days ago, you asked me to give you some more information concerning my journey to the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>I'm a teacher in Vienna, my holiday starts on July 1st. For August I booked a journey to Greece with my wife. That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S. in July.</P>
      <P>I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I got accostomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at the army - I would prefer log cabin for my stay in the camp.</P>
      <P>Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy, I still enjoy swimming especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition, that means I do swimming just for fun.</P>
      <P>The other activity I choose is Photography. Usually I take just holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art....</P>
      <P>I think there are no more questions I'm looking forward to seeing you.</P>
      <P>Yours</P>

      <P>I'm the teacher of that class. The children are seven to eight years old. The video that will be made should demonstrate how day in school is like.</P>
      <P>- I start the day by greeting the children and they answer - in English, of course. Then I tell them to sit down.</P>
      <P>- The first lesson will deal with animals on a farm. I will show pictures of animals and the children will tell me the name of that animal.</P>
      <P>- Later on we'll go to sing the song of "Old McDonald had a farm".</P>
      <P>- The third part of the film will show the children's painting work "Animals on a farm".</P>
      <P>- Some sequences of the gym-lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that presents how children have their lunch and spend their free-time, what games they play in the school-yard and how they have contact with each other.</P>
      <P>Each part of the film mentioned above should not be longer than 5 to 10 minutes. The whole film when it's finished will last for about half an hour.</P>
