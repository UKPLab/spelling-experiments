      <P>Dear Sir:</P>
      <P>I'm writting this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London. This show was supposed to be a perfect event but actually I had a very disappointing evening.</P>
      <P>First of all I want to say that I'm very keen on Danny Brook who was one of the main reasons why I decided to come. However my favourite actor was not there. How could that happen?</P>
      <P>I also would like to know why the musical show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven. I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start. I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me as long as I had been informed about it.</P>
      <P>Of course discounts were not available either, and the restaurant where we were supposed to eat afterwards was closed without any explanation at all.</P>
      <P>So, what should have been a nice evening out came to a nightmare.</P>
      <P>I guess all my reasons are more than enough to get my money back.</P>
      <P>Thank you very much:</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully:</P>

      <P>Modern technology has actually changed my life quite a lot.</P>
      <P>Firstly I would like to talk about computers. A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them. Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they work. Now, I'm just fascinated by Internet and I spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free.</P>
      <P>I'm impressed by communications as well. If I want to communicate with a friend in Australia I just have to send him an e-mail which is going to get to my fellow in a while. Isn't that amazing?</P>
      <P>I should not forget mobile phones. If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and whereever he is I will be able to get through to him. Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile which is going to be great.</P>
      <P>Finally I want to explain that three weeks ago I started working for a new company and my job is all about new technologies. I'm extremly happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I'm learning a lot.</P>
      <P>So, as you can see, modern technology has had influence in my life.</P>
