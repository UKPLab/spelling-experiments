      <P>16th November 2000</P>
      <P>Dear Sir</P>
      <P>I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show. According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the actors weren't those announced. Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove; we had mean actors.</P>
      <P>As for the times, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15.</P>
      <P>Likewise, there were no discounts avalaible.</P>
      <P>To end, in spite of being opened, the restaurant was closed for reparations.</P>
      <P>Because of all those inconvenients, I ask you a total refund. I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company. You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</P>
      <P>So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important; because she trusted in him; immediatly he came to see one of his friend to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students of her class knew about what she had just said the day before to Pat.</P>
      <P>So immediatly she went towards Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up.</P>
      <P>Because of his behaviour, now Pat is alone and nobody trust in him.</P>
