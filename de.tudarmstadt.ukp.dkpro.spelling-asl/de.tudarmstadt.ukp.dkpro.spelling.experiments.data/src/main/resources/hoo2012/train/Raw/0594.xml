      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show "Over The Rainbow." Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was offered in the advertisements was provided.</P>
      <P>Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late.</P>
      <P>As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have "a perfect evening" as it was written, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely,</P>

      <P>MY LIFE AND MODERN TECHNOLOGY</P>
      <P>Here we are, in the 21st century... We live in a technologically well-developed world, having every opportunity for communication, education and entertainment. Almost everyone has televisions, computers and electronic devices. But how has modern technology changed our lives?</P>
      <P>If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic alarm-clock wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat in the internet..." There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world.</P>
      <P>When I look at my life, I can understand I am dependent on the machines. My daily life is programmed up to the virtual world I created. Modern technology has changed my life completely.</P>
