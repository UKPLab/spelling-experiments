      <P>Dear Ryan</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning of the competition. I am writing to inform you my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July. I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July. And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent. I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel wilder experience. While I am at the camp, I would like to enjoy swimming and photography. It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy fresh air. Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can.</P>
      <P>I would like to know about the weather in the camp area because I don't know what kinds of clothes I have to bring. And I want to know how much money I have to carry for personnal expences. I also want to know if I can have a time for shopping.</P>
      <P>Thank you for your kindness and I look forward to your reply.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Clark.</P>
