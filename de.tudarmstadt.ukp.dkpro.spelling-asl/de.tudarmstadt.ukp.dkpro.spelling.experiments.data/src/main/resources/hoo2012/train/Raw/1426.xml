      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show which happened to be inaccurate at the leaflet given.</P>
      <P>Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him.</P>
      <P>Another point which caused some inconveniences was the timetable of the show. It began 45 minutes later than it should have been.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket, it occuried to be impossible to have one.</P>
      <P>Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open it was not the case because of a lack of available staff.</P>
      <P>All those innacuracies spoilt what should have been a memoriable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from you.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>T. Gens</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell it to someone. It was far too heavy to keep it for myself. So I made a mistake and I told her.</P>
      <P>The day after, at school, I noticed that everyone was looking at me. I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat. She denied having revealed my secret but she was averting my eyes.</P>
      <P>From this moment, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know it sooner or later. It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse. I tried to take it on my stride but I couldn't. I was terrified.</P>
      <P>My fear turned out to be right. I read the hurt in her eyes. She knew. She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice before it.</P>
