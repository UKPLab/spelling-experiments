      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>Last week, I was on holiday in London, and reading the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (like it is said) "a perfect evening out".</P>
      <P>But it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct at all, or I must have been to the wrong show!</P>
      <P>According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing!</P>
      <P>The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing.</P>
      <P>I was a little hungry after the show, but then again, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets..</P>
      <P>But I found out afterwards and it was too late.</P>
      <P>Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with her: she could do anything to have friends, even betray me.</P>
      <P>No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. "He's travelling around the world" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But know Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man.</P>
      <P>Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same. Everyone, even my friends, looked at me in a strange kind of way. As if I was guilty. What did I have to do with this? I wasn't the one who had killed the man, but it seemed people didn't want to talk to me anymore.</P>
      <P>I knew, now, why I wanted to hide the truth.</P>
