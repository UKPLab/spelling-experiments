      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing to you for explaining some problems I had when I went to the theatre to see one of your company's musical shows called "Over the rainbow". I would like to say that the information given in your advertisement was not true at all.</P>
      <P>First of all, the main characters had to be Danny Brook an Tina Truelove. I got very disappointed when I discovered Danny Brook was not going to play and a different actor would play instead of him.</P>
      <P>Another problem was the start of the show. When I finished working I had to hurry up because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. For my surprise, when I arrived to the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15!</P>
      <P>You should review the advertisements you do because you give wrong information. For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets with discounts, but when I went to buy it your employees told me there were no discounts available.</P>
      <P>When the show was over I went to have dinner to your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacked of employees.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, what I expected to be "my perfect evening", as you said in your advertisement, was a very disappointing evening due to the problems I had. I would like to know if I could have some money back for these problems I have told you.</P>
      <P>I advise you to pay more attention in your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P>MANUEL SANTOS</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Two days ago I thought I could trust Pat because she was not going to tell anybody our secret, our important secret. I wish I had never told her anything.</P>
      <P>All began when, three days ago, I was doing homework in my class. I was alone because Pat had to go with her parents to the cinema. Suddenly, I heard step noises that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher went out the class. I was boried, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. "See you tomorrow!" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my class I saw he hadn't switched off the light of his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had forgotten our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do next day were there. Without thinking it twice, I took one of them and went quickly home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which were the questions of the exam. When I told her this piece of news, she got surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell it anybody else. Next day in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams.</P>
      <P>But my plan didn't work well. Next day, everybody knew about my great finding because Pat hadn't kept our secret. The problem was that my teacher also knew it because someone had told him "the story of the exams", as he called my big problem. He told me I had done wrong taking the exam but I think the only thing I did wrong was telling Pat my important secret. Next time I will get sure who I'm telling my secret to.</P>
