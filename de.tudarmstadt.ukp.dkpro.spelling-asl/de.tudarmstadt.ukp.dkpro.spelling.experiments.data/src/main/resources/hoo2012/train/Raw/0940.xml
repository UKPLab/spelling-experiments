      <P>Dear Sir/Madam</P>
      <P>During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre. I found your advertisement in the tourism officis and how the musical "Over the rainbow" seemed to be a good option I choose it.</P>
      <P>The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm student but I paid a full ticket).</P>
      <P>How it was explained above, I'm not satisfied and I want to be refund.</P>
      <P>yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend which is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot. We'll understand why I'm writing in the past.</P>
      <P>When we met the girls Eingrid was furious, she said me that Pat had saw me kissing another girl and our relationship was over! I'm really very unlucked. </P>
