      <P>Dear Miss Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have safely received your letter bringing the good news. I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found that I won the competition. Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received.</P>
      <P>I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my semester holidays and that it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience.</P>
      <P>Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.</P>
      <P>Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.</P>
      <P>Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just stay in Camp California all the time?</P>
      <P>I hope that I haven't taken up too much time. Thank you for this exciting news. I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime!</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>(Au Kwan Ming)</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience.</P>
      <P>The concert was held at our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.</P>
      <P>Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements.</P>
      <P>I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.</P>
      <P>I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular. It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers.</P>
      <P>I really enjoyed myself and I hope that you can have the chance to experience this too. I hope that you can write to me soon. I look forward to reading what you have to say. Bye for now!</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>
