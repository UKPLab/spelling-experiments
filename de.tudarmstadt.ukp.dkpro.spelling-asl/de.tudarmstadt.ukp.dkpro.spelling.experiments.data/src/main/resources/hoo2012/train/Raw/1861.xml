      <P>The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show "Over the Rainbow," I attended to, a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset when I realized that the expected famous actor Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy; this entertainment did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. More over, I was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing as, indicated on your adverts, but I, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. "A Perfect evening out"!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque of Â£15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I had made my own experience with her so far and I would be always careful not to tell her anything important when ever we met.</P>
      <P>As, Pat had recently made a new friend with Olga, my sister, I warned my sibling about Pat's failing: "Don't ever rely on Pat for keeping a secret, Sweet-Heart; she just can't"! Mind what you may tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping around is her favorite leisure activity!</P>
      <P>However, I guess that Olga turned a deaf hear to what I had told her. This is the impression I got.</P>
      <P>A couple of weeks later, my sister called me as I was at work; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears, she could, hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving over herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then, feel her, upset as ever. I could get her as well simmer for a second or two then she suddenly sarted shouting uncontrollably: - "Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat", hurled Olga at me, through the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the "poor cow"!</P>
