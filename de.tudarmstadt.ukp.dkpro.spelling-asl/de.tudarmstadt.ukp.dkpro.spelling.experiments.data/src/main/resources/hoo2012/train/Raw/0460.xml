      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in going to two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel on July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month.</P>
      <P>For the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I can not sleep in tent.</P>
      <P>I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for speed sensations. I am good in those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend.</P>
      <P>I would like to now more information about clothes. I think that weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold, but I do not know if I must take lot of pullovers.</P>
      <P>Best regards</P>
      <P>Henri</P>

      <P>"Shopping is not always enjoyable" is a statement of men in general. Women like to go to do shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands. Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive. Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because the shopping loses a lot of time controry, because if they have a free time, they will go to do shopping.</P>
      <P>I think that child does not like shopping because he often waits, and I prefer to play with these friends. He goes to do shopping only if he has not clothes.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I think that "Shopping is not always enjoyable" is a true statement, but not always for all people.</P>
