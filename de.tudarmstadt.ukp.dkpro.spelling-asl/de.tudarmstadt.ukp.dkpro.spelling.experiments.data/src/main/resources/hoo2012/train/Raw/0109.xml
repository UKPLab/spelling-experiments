      <P>I feel very happy to be the winner of your competition. I would like to travel in July only because they will need me at work in August.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I have never done it and I think it is an experience not to be missed, a very original adventure!</P>
      <P>I would like to do singing and swimming. For the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very few experience in it.</P>
      <P>Concerning swimming, I practise this sport once a week on myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer!</P>
      <P>Otherwise, I would like to ask you which clothes I will have to take in my luggage. What is the weather like in July? Is it worth to take a raincoat? Should I take trainers?</P>
      <P>Finally, how much money must I bring with me? Is it necessary to ask for Travellers' Cheques? Or is it better to take only an international credit card?</P>

      <P>Going for shopping is a good thing when you don't know what to do but it has also many disavantages.</P>
      <P>First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are on week-end. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are embarrassed with the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want.</P>
      <P>Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had to find a cloth for a precise day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it.</P>
      <P>However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what to do. You can discover a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant to try many clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny!</P>
      <P>Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible. For instance, if you try a cloth which fits you well, it can contribute to make you feel better.</P>
