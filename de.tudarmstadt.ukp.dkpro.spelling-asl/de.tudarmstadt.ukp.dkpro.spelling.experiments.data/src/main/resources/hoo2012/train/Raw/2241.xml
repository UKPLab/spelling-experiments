      <P>Dear Sir or Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre "Over The Rainbow".</P>
      <P>I went to see it on time as it was written 19:30 but it started t 20:15 with a delay of 45 minutes.</P>
      <P>This is nothing, it was said that Danny Brook was starring. However a different actor starred and we were all disappointed.</P>
      <P>What is more, about the tickets, discounts were not available as it was not said so.</P>
      <P>The last disappointing thing is that the theatre restaurant was closed so we could not visit it after the show.</P>
      <P>As well as you can understand I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money for a nonsense thing. Therefore, if avaliable, can you play my money back please? My address is here for any contacts,</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>PAT LIKE A BLACK CAT</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He told everything that Pandora said, to everyone which Pandora didn't want them to know.</P>
      <P>Pandora had done something very bad like a robbery and one day told this to Pat because she was very shy and regretful. Pat was her best friend so she told to him. However, she didn't know that Pat couldn't keep secrets well.</P>
      <P>One day while all their friends were there and talking, Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery. All of them were schoked by what they heard. As well as this they started to talk about it everywhere.</P>
      <P>After a week of holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that every of her friends knew that. She became very shy and engry She couldn't talk with people and she just was very sad.</P>
      <P>Finally, she couldn't wait and wear to talk to Pat. He admitted that it was his fault to say and told everyone that it was a joke to make Pandora a bit angry. After all they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets.</P>
