      <P>To Whom It May Concern,</P>
      <P>I'd like to say thank you for choosing me and sending me the letter. I am extremely excited about the camp! For the camp, you need some information from me, don't you? Therefore I am going to write them down.</P>
      <P>First, I'd like to travel on July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto on August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Second, I prefer log cabins than tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents.</P>
      <P>Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities. Because I've started surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing. Also, painting is one of my favorite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions. I know everything is included and I don't need to pay anything but in case should I bring some money or not? And if I need to bring some money could you suggest me the amount?</P>
      <P>Also, could you suggest me what kind of clothes I should bring, please?</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for reading this letter. I really appreciate your choosing me. I am really looking forward this camp. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Truly,</P>
      <P>Yoshiko Murasaki</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Hi! How are you? I'm fine, thanks.</P>
      <P>Anyway, I really enjoyed helpying at a pop concert last month so that I'd like to write them down!</P>
      <P>First, we went to this office to apply for this job. The interview was OK and my friend and I was hired!</P>
      <P>Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our heart was bumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do so we started working.</P>
      <P>After working 30 minute, a singer appeared. While we were organizing the concert, she was singing on a stage. We could listen for free! I just imagined what it was like to be a singer. If only I could sing beautifully!</P>
      <P>Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thusands of funs came in this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert.</P>
      <P>During the concert, we had to stand to protect this singer. We saw some very strange fans but most of them were quite nice. Actually, they were well-behaved.</P>
      <P>Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer. Also, we got some posteres as well.</P>
      <P>It was a great experience for me and my friend. I wish you were there with us! Maybe next time!</P>
      <P>By the way, I think I should go. Please take care and please write to me, right?</P>
      <P>Love,</P>
      <P>Yoshiko.</P>
