      <P>Dear Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California. I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so it is the only month in which I can travel. I would be grateful if I could have the accomodation in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height, I am so tall that I could never stand up. I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be suitable not to stop practising it during July. I can play basketball very well I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf. I have never practised this sport, so I can't play golf at all.</P>
      <P>Would you mind sending me some information about the kind of clothes I will need? I would like to know how much money you suggest to bring. I would be grateful to receive some information about the meals at the camp and I hope that it will not be a problem for you if I am a vegan.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you,</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Elena Pabori</P>

      <P>I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school-day, we should film the large number of sport activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>Only who gets good marks can take part in theese activities, so sport activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone....</P>
      <P>In my opinion we should film science lesson, so that our teacher, listening to her own statements could realise that they make no sense!</P>
