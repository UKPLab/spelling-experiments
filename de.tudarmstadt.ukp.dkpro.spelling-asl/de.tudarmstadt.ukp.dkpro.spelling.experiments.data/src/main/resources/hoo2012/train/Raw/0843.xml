      <P>Dear sir or madam,</P>
      <P>I have recently been on a holiday in London. During my stay I went to see the musical "Over the Rainbow". Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed.</P>
      <P>First the advertisement said that there were discounts available but there were not.</P>
      <P>Secondly I also would like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15. Finally when it started we noticed to our suprisement that it was not the right actor. Very disappointing as Danny Brook is my favourite actor. We saw the musical in sadness.</P>
      <P>Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasent dinner. To our surprise the restaurant was closed because the lack of staff to keep it open.</P>
      <P>It was certainly not a perfect night out. I would be very pleased if I could have my money back. I hope to receive the payment as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully</P>
      <P>FREDA SVENSSEN</P>

      <P>Fashion of the future</P>
      <P>What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that.</P>
      <P>I gave it a thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind from plastic-fabrics. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes.</P>
      <P>I mean when the earth's getting warmer and warmer because of an pollution that we people cause the world. Maybe in the future they'll find out a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine.</P>
      <P>Maybe everybody will end up wearing shorts and skirts. Strict suits will be transformed into a school-uniform-like shirt and knee-lengthed shorts.</P>
      <P>Anyway we defenately now that they're going to change. If we live long enough we'll be able to find out, so keep living!</P>
