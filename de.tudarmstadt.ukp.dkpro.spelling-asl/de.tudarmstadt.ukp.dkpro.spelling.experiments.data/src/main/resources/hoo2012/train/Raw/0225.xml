      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>The reason for which I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you. I hope you will not feel offensed, but I really needed to contest about your theater.</P>
      <P>I was present at your musical show: "Over the rainbow". It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening.</P>
      <P>Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here! You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it! How rude!</P>
      <P>Moreover; it was written that the show was supposed to start at 19.30; it actually started at exactly 20.15! 45 minutes latter: where we had nothing to do, but waiting. We couldn't even have a drink, because, obviously, the restaurant you talked about was closed!</P>
      <P>Really, what a mess in the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reached either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful client.</P>
      <P>Sincerely yours,</P>

      <P>If more and more ingenors work on science and technology, it must be that it is really usefull: but in what particular way?</P>
      <P>For my part, I know it would be such a pain in my neck. The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot. I guess I could not live without many instruments.</P>
      <P>The first I think of is internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do. It also makes me write to my friends by e-mail. I did not to write at all to people until I have got internet. By this procedure, you only type and send, no need to going to the post-office!</P>
      <P>Of course this is just because I am lazy, I actually could force me a little, and then go to the library and to the post-office, but internet just makes it easier!</P>
      <P>I am also very fond of cell-phones. These are also such a relief. I can go anywhere without being nervous about the fact, that maybe someone is trying to reach me!</P>
      <P>Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman. Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me to be more peaceful and I think it is essential.</P>
      <P>Although I am thankful to modern technology!</P>
