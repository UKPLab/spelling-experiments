      <P>Dear Sir/Madam,</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about the musical 'OVER THE RAINBOW'. There were some unfortunate incidents.</P>
      <P>To begin with, according to your advertisement, discount tickets were availabe. However, I could not get them. So I could get a good seat.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. As a result, I could not visit the restaurant since it had already closed when the show finished.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, it was the different actor although Danny Brook should have starred. I was really looking forward to seeing his role, but on starting the show, I found it disappointed. Can you imagine how upset I was?</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask you to give some money back to me.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving your satisfactory reply by return of post.</P>
      <P>Yours faithfully,</P>

      <P>In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life greatly.</P>
      <P>To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box. When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it with the phone. On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb my time, the phone annoys me.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention. With internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live in abroad. Since I bought a computer, I have been checking E-mails from my friend almost every day. Finding them, I feel happy even if there is only one.</P>
      <P>On balance then, I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it improves too rapidly to catch up.</P>
