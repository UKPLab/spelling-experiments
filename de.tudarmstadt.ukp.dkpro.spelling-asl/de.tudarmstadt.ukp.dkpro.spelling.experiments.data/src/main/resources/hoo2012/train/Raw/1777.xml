      <P>Dear Ms. Ryan,</P>
      <P>It was wonderful surprise when I received your letter. Thank you very much for this great opportunity. Now, I am writing this letter to reply your questions.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only in July, which is the only month I can take holiday from my work.</P>
      <P>Secondly, for accomodation, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try.</P>
      <P>Regarding to the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports. However, I enjoy singing. I used to join the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my favorite hobbies.</P>
      <P>I normally bring blushes, paints and paper instead of camera when I travel.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to ask you wheather anything I should bring to this travel such as specific clothes, extra money etc.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving your reply.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Thanks for your letter. Yes! It was a privelage to help at a pop concert. I really wished you were there with me. Believe it or not, it was a concert of "the Rolling Stones"! I did various things for them.</P>
      <P>At first, I helped stage setting, as you know they use lots of unique tricks in their concert. So it was very interesting to know how they are made.</P>
      <P> Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band. Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turning the volume up and down following to the musician's instruction.</P>
      <P>My dear friend, if I tell you this, I am sure you will get jelous. This was the best experience. I could give the members "Shiatsu massage" just before the concert to make them relax!! Can you imagine how much I appreciated that I am qualified in massage?</P>
      <P>Well, Kim, I have to go now. Hope to hear from you soon.</P>
      <P>Love,</P>
