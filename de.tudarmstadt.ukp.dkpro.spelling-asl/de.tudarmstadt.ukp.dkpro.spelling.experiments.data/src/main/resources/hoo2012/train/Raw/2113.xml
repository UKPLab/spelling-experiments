      <P>Dear Kim,</P>
      <P>Last month I had a great time in Derby. I went with Big Brothers the name of the band.</P>
      <P>As I told you two month ago I saw the advertisment in the newspepper. This group was looking for Manager. I went for interview and I got the job. They did not new each one. They just meet each one a month ago.</P>
      <P>During the time before the consert I had to look if every one was present. Also I had to look for dried place in case it was raining. I really liked. I had to run all the times. This was my job and I like what I am doing. The consert was briliant.</P>
      <P>I am looking to hear the new from yours group. I hope all the best for you!</P>
      <P>With Love</P>
