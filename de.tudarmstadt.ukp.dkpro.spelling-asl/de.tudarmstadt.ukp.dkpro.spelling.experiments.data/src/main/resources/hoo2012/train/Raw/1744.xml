      <P>Manager of the theatre:</P>
      <P>I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed. I'm not from here (this city), so I wanted to know everything about it: it's culture, history and the famous musicals. Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical show. I went to the theatre to see at what time was the show, 19.30, it was O.K. so I bought a ticket. In that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that mean, that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 mins, the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, it was a different actor. In that moment I was realy angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad cleaning and food. That was too much. "Dear" manager I hope you to understand me, so I ask for money back and I hope this wont happen again. By</P>

      <P>First of all I think we have grown with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our live, but we can think about it. How has it change my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life comfortabler. Now I only used to push a button, and things or mashines work on their own. Homework is easer to find in the cumputer than in a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology go so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it make us thing more about my future job. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things worked and that scare me, I will be useless, because a mashine will do all the work.</P>
