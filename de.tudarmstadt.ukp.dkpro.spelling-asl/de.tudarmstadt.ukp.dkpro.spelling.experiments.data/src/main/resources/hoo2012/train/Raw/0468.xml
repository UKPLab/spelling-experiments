      <P>Dear misses Helen Ryan,</P>
      <P>I'm surprised to read that I've won the first prize. So I would travel on July because I've got only there free time. I've got a lot of work and my boss didn't allowed me to leave my job any other time.</P>
      <P>I prefer to stay in a tent because it's more like a camp. And so I can I be better in touch with the nature. I'm happy to read that I will have the chance to do two activities there. I chose painting and photography. I like painting and I have talent, I could paint all the day. Photography is a relaxing activity. You can photograph all kind of arts you want. I take very good photos!</P>
      <P>I would ask you about clothes and money. What kind of clothes should I bring with me? And what about money? Do you pay for all? And for food, drinks etc?</P>
      <P>I'm looking forward hearing news from you.</P>
      <P>Yours </P>

      <P>Shopping is not always enjoyable</P>
      <P>We people are often depressed or have stress. What are we doing then? We go shopping. That makes often women feel better. They go out with friends or alone. But shopping is not always enjoyable.</P>
      <P>A friend of mine was depressed because her friend leave her. She phone me and asked me what about going shopping. I suggest and we went shopping. In the time we want to go out of a shop a man stopped us and hold a pistol in his hand. We were scared and so we did all what he told us. We were lucky that we are in life now. The police came and took hi to the jail (police station).</P>
      <P>You can't be carefullhappens. But you can be carefull when you speak with him or her that will stolen your thinks.</P>
