      <P>Dear Sir</P>
      <P>During my holidays in London I went to see your musical show.</P>
      <P>It was a very unpleasent evening. First of all, it had read on the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring at this show. But someone else participated instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing.</P>
      <P>The second problem was the start of the show. It began at 20:15 and not at 19:30! That's almost an hour later. I had read that there would be available some discounts, but I became none of them.</P>
      <P>The restaurant should had been oppened when I came out, but it was closed because of the hour the show finished.</P>
      <P>It wasn't a perfect evening at all. I hope you can understand my disappointment and ask for my money back.</P>
      <P>Faithfully yours,</P>

      <P>In our days, nobody can live without technology.</P>
      <P>My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The timer of my radio wakes me up at half past six.</P>
      <P>I stand up, go the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave.</P>
      <P>After breakfeast I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always reach late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to make compositions, to print some pictures or to surf on the internet. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends per telephone.</P>
      <P>Without these technology I would get realy bored.</P>
      <P>Now, I loose less of time and can use the technology to enjoy myself.</P>
