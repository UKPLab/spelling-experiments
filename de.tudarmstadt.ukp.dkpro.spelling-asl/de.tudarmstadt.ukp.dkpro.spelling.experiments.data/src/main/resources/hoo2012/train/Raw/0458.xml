      <P>Dear Jane Clark,</P>
      <P>I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have visited.</P>
      <P>First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great. It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultures' variety of the whole world. However, at this festival there were artists only from six countries. Whereas an advertisement promised stars from around the world.</P>
      <P>Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable. Although, some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival.</P>
      <P>Another disadvatage of the festival's programme was lack of plays and films which are the best to display the modern county's culture. I suppose. I hope there will be more of them next year.</P>
      <P>I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events. That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced.</P>
      <P>In conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done. For example, the next year's one may last not for two days only, but for a week. So it will be available for greater amount of people.</P>
      <P>The programme can be also improved by adding new categories such as folk songs.</P>
      <P>Thank you for your kind attention.</P>
      <P>Sincerely yours,</P>

      <P>Everybody wants to earn a bit of money. Especially young people who are always out of their small budget. Fortunatelly, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays.</P>
      <P>Of course, young people can work only in their spare time. It mean that a job should be part-time.</P>
      <P>So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish for example.</P>
      <P>Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy however. But you can earn more. Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday.</P>
      <P>But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may chose a more pieceful job of a typist at home. There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer. So, you can help them and earn quiete.</P>
      <P>To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in Arctic.</P>
