      <P>17th June 2000</P>
      <P>Dear Sir/Madam</P>
      <P>I am writing to complain about the musical show of "OVER THE RAINBOW" which I saw on 15th of June in your theatre.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK playing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him at that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed by 20:15.</P>
      <P>As for the ticket price, you promised to provide discount tickets, but they were not available. Furthermore, when I went to the restaurant after the show, I found it was closed. Because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00.</P>
      <P>I do not need to tell, either, that I had awful evening and you are responsible for that. So I am asking to refund all the money.</P>
      <P>Thanking for your prompt attention.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.</P>
      <P>Yours Faithfully</P>
      <P>Tyung Kwa (Miss)</P>

      <P>THE REVOLUTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</P>
      <P>I am checking my e-mail everyday using the Internet, I am talking to my friends who is far away connecting to network systems, and I am taking my mobile phone.</P>
      <P>For recent years, as Information Technology has been improved highly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not same as before.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, I did not know what Internet was, how to use it and so on. But, while those have been spread all over the world, I and all the other people who I have known became to use them.</P>
      <P>I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to library. I am able to meet my friends quickly in Internet just clicking the mouse. In addition to these, I can contact to anyone who I want to talk at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed.</P>
      <P>It is causing some changes to me. So, now I would rather send the e-mail than the letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster.</P>
