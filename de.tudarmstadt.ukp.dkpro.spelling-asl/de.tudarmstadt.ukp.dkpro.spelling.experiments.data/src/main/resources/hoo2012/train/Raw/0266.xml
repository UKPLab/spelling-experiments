      <P>Dear Jane Clark,</P>
      <P>I'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organiced the last 21 and 22 of November.</P>
      <P>I want you to know how extraordinary moments I passed with my friends in the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world with only that reasonable-priced ticket we paid for all the weekend. The festival was very well organiced with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. On my point of view the hall of the rock concets was too small, you've to consider make a big one for the next year because these kind of events are concurred by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such an special weekend.</P>
      <P>Yours Sincerely,</P>

      <P>Dear Miguel</P>
      <P>Thanks for your letter. I got it a couple of days ago and I've been thinking about what you said. I'm going to tell you what I feel.</P>
      <P>In my house rules practically don't exist because I have 18 years old now so my parents only wish is that I study a carrear and be a good man. They only want to know where I am and when I go out at what time I came home. At school is complete different because the teachers don't foregive you nothing. You have to be quiet an attention in class if you wouldn't to be punished. I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things. I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some dicipline to make the right things.</P>
      <P>When I'd time I will write you again</P>
      <P>Love,</P>
